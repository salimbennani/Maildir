I believe that I mentioned this more times. 16 buffers is the first
attempt. We could improve it later in several ways:

  + add more buffers
  + combine buffers on stack, dynamically allocated and static ones.

BTW: I do not remember seeing mixed lines from anything even close to 16
CPUs. Maybe I was just lucky or my memory is leaky.

We will always have this problem with API using explicit buffers.
What do you suggest instead, please?

I am afraid that we are running in cycles. The other serious
alternative was having per-process and per-context buffers
but it was rejected several times.

The static array of buffers can be flushed on panic.

Do you have any alternative proposal how to handle OOM and lockdep, please?

My undestanding is that the new API is similar to the current cont
buffer from this point of view:

    + buffer size is LOG_LINE_MAX
    + it is flushed when full

The only difference is that it is flushed also when there is a
complete line. Is this a problem, please?

I was against this idea several times. The current API does
not do anything like this.

This API tries to handle continuous lines more reliably.
Do I miss anything, please?
