Just to be clear was this a Dell adapter or another manufacturer?

If it's non-Dell, there could easily be an untested combination of controll=
ers
and one getting into a bad state.

That's the same hypothesis I would have come to in these circumstances.

I haven't heard of this particular issue in the past, but that doesn't mean
anything since I don't work in Dell's support group or have access to their
call information.

Is this a 1 time occurrence or something you can regularly trigger with the
right set of events?

As you know if you can't trigger it regularly it's going to be just as hard
for this to be reproduced and fixed by the engineering team maintaining
this platform.

If you can trigger it regularly (or semi-regularly even) the right way to r=
eport
it would be to contact the ProSupport team, explain the circumstances that
can cause it and they would escalate it to the proper channels.

Sorry I can't be more helpful.

Is this with the DA200 or DA300?  Or something else?

I think it would be worth checking this with drm-tip, and if it keeps repro=
ducing
there then:
1) Check if UCSI sysfs can tell you anything about what accessory mode the =
device is operating in.
I'm not sure if accessory_mode gets populated by the EC, but if it does it =
might be useful to debug.

2) Boot with drm.debug=3D0xe and double check the differences around the ci=
rcumstances
of it working or not working.  Having to boot with it plugged in for it to =
work tells
me that it's either the wrong type C alternate mode coming up for this adap=
ter or the graphics
driver not getting along with the adapter.

3) Raising it with the graphics mailing list.

It sounds like this one might be more reproducible.  If it's a Dell periphe=
ral I think it should be
pretty easy for support to reproduce and escalate.
