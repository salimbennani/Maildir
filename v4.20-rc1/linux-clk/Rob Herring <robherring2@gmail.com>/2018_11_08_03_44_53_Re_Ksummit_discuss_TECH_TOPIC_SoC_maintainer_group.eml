Given that dts files are a large part of what goes into arm-soc, any
thoughts on changes to the process around them? I think it would be
good if dts files were a bit more decoupled from kernel code changes.
Yes, there's the issue with header dependencies to deal with. Ignoring
that for a moment, keeping the dts files somewhat separate even if
ultimately in the same tree and the same maintainers would be
beneficial both for perception and to be able to do validation
separately. And if we do ever move things out of the kernel tree, then
it's less of a work-flow change. And I'm happy to help out here in
whatever way I can.

AIUI for drm-misc, a major goal there is to have more automated checks
fed back to submitters which doesn't necessarily have anything to do
with maintainers. That's something I want to get in front of for DT
schema so we're not fixing things after we've accepted them. So I've
been experimenting with gitlab CI and integration with patchwork a bit
recently. I have gitlab CI running some tests on binding patches
(checkpatch and schema validation), attaching the results to the DT
patchwork instance, and updating the patch state. Here is an example
patch[1], my patchwork related scripts are here[2], and the CI job is
here[3].
