You're doing in probe:

  if (pwm_is_running()):
    mux(pin, function=pwm)
  else:
    gpio_set_value(gpio, 0)
    mux(pin, function=gpio)

This gives you the right level assuming the gpio specification uses the
right flag (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH or GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW).

Taking your example with the backlight device you specify an "init" and
a "default" pinctrl and only "default" contains the muxing for the PWM
pin everything should be as smooth as necessary: The pwm is only muxed
when the backlight device is successfully bound. The probe function (of
the backlight) should have initialized the PWM with the right polarity.
Until then nothing happens on the pin (either because it's not muxed as
PWM or because the PWM is already initialized by the bootloader).

The only thing that is (maybe) needed on top of my change is that the
pwm isn't stopped in pwm-imx's .probe.

No I meant the pwm. Well, it's as easy as that: Whenever with your
approach you configure the pin as GPIO with the output set to low,
instead configure the pwm with duty_cycle to zero (or disable it).
Whenever with your approach you configure the pin as GPIO with the
output set to high, configure the pwm with duty_cycle to 100%. (Keeping
out inverted PWMs for the ease of discussion, but the procedure can be
adapted accordingly.) The only difference then is that with your
approach you already "know" in pwm-imx's .probe the idle level and can
configure the GPIO accordingly. With my approach you just have to wait
until the first pwm_apply which (as described above) works just as well.

I don't see why anybody should care if the PWM is "disabled". A user
should only care about the output level, how the pwm-imx driver
implements this is out of scope. As backlight-pwm user/author you
shouldn't even care which PWM driver is in use. It might be even an
implementation that cannot be disabled (like the bcm-kona one).

With the above changes there is no relevant difference between your and
my approach. I save your and my time to repeat this once more with these
nice pictures. (If you don't believe me, I can do this later if you
wish.) The nice upside of my approach however is that the pwm-imx driver
stays simpler and the dts author doesn't need to care to add a gpio
specifier and two pinmux configurations instead of one.

I don't see a compatibility issue here.
