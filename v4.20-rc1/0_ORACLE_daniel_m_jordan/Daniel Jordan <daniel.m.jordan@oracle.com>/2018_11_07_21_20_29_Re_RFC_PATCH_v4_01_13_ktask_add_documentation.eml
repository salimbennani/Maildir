Ok, I've consulted my thesaurus and everything.  Best I can come up with is
just 'parallel', so for example parallel_run would be the interface.  Or
para_run.

Going to think about this more, and I'm open to suggestions.

Sure, I'll see how it goes.

Assuming you mean sync.  It doesn't have to be synchronous always, but some
users need that.  A caller that clears a page shouldn't return to userland
before the job is done.

Anyway, sure, it may come out clean to encapsulate the async parts of async.c
into their own paths and then find a new name for that file.  I'll see how this
goes too.

Ok, I (think) I see what you meant.  If nobody is waiting on it, as in, it's
not desirable from a performance POV.  Agree.

Will do.
