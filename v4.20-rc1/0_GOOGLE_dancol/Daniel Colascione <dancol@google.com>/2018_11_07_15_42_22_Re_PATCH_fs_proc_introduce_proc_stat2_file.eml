First of all, is sysfs even right? Some people, for whatever reason,
are extremely particular about the purposes of various virtual
filesystems. "No, sysfs is for exposing kernel objects, not
configuration!" is something I've heard more than once. Who's to say
that sysfs is for exposing /proc/pid/stat, which isn't a "kernel
object" itself? (A process is not its struct task.) More generally,
objections about APIs rooted in arcane kernel-internal considerations
about the purposes of various virtual filesystems --- procfs, sysfs,
debugfs, configfs --- makes the userspace API worse, because it
enshrines implementation details (is this thing a kobject or not?) in
public API. If I had my way, we'd have continued putting *everything*
in procfs and just make procfs the "I want stuff from the kernel" API.
Nobody in userspace cares about these filesystem divisions.

Second, slurping from a sysfs-style setup in which there's one file
per piece of information creates massive overhead, because there's
currently no way to open multiple paths with one system call and no
way to read from multiple FDs with one system call. If you want this
kind of setup to work, you need some kind of batched openat-and-read
system call mechanism. I think a simple "get information from this
procfs FD" system call --- something like statx --- is both cleaner
and more efficient. Plus, without a batch operation, there's no way to
achieve atomicity. It's perfectly reasonable for userspace to request
some bits of information about a process want these bits to be
consistent with each other. Now, such an API would be good to add, but
it's not enough, since a generic batched openat-and-read would still
have to go through VFS, create struct files, (probably) encode to
ASCII, and so on. Why should any system pay to do that much work when
the fields anyone might want could be obtained with a simple
copy_to_user?

Third, and finally, a sysfs-style tree for processes doesn't currently
exist. Would you propose having *two* *different* representations of
the process list as virtual filesystems? That's another pointless
exposure of internal kernel divisions in the user API. We already have
procfs. Let's just make it better.
