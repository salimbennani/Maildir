Sure, whatever you don't need in RISC-V you can see if they can be made
optional. I don't think that should be a problem.

No, we have it and we will continue to support it. It's not broken to
fix on ARM64. Why do you think that it's broken on ARM64 ?

Sure, hang on this idea of scripting, we can make a better use of it.
Details later further in the mail.

I think Mark has already explain why/how generic bindings are useful.
If you still have concerns, take it up separately and see how you can
build *perfect* bindings for RISC-V to avoid any legacy baggage.

We have reasons why we can't assume information about cache or power
domain topology from CPU topology. I have summarised them already and
we are not discussing. There may not be perfect bindings but there are
already supported and nothing is broken here to fix. DT bindings are
*not* same as code to fix it with a patch to the bindings themselves.
Once agreed and merged, they need to be treated like user ABI.

Ah, here comes. If you want to save people's time or whatever, you can use
your scripting magic you have mentioned above to define those bunch of nodes
you want to avoid.

Sure, I don't have strong opinions there. Just stop mentioning that this
is the only solution and all existing ones are broken. They are not and
needs to be supported until they are explicitly deprecated, becomes
obsolete and finally removed.

Sure, you can always unless you stop treating existing ones are broken.
I have already told DT bindings are not *normal code*. You can just
replace existing ones with new optimised ones. You can only add the new
(*optimised*) ones to the existing ones. You *need* to understand that
concept first, otherwise there's not point in this endless discussion
IMO.

I will stop here as I will have to repeat whatever I have already
mentioned to comment on your arguments below.

In summary, I am not against improving the bindings if you think it's
possible, but I don't see how it's more beneficially especially if we
are going to support existing ones also. Mark has already given all the
details.
