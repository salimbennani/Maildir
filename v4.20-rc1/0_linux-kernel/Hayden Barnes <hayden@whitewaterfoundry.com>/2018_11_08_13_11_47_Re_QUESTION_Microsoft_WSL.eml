Mr. Caputo,

Hello. That was my idea. Please allow me to address some of the concerns yo=

The Linux trademark is owned by Linus Torvalds and administered by the Linu=
x Foundation=20
through the Linux Mark Institute: https://www.linuxmark.org. The Linux trad=
emark can be=20
used by third parties subject to a Sublicense Agreement:=20
https://www.linuxmark.org/programs/legal/trademark/sublicense-agreement.=20

The terms of the Sublicense Agreement permit the use of the Linux trademark=
 for derivative=20
goods and services that deploy, document, facilitate the use of, or enhance=
 Linux=C2=AD-based goods.

WLinux does contain a bootable Linux kernel in a base image.  The criticism=
 that 'WSL is=20
not Linux' is because the kernel is not executed when the base image is ins=
talled and run=20
from within the WSL layer on Windows 10. But WLinux can be used to patch an=
d build the=20
Linux kernel from sources to install on other devices, assist in deploying =
and configuring=20
Linux on other devices, and can cross-compile software using standard Linux=
 libraries,=20
all when running on WSL. For more about how WSL works for those unfamiliar:=
=20
https://github.com/sirredbeard/Awesome-WSL#overview. WLinux unquestionably =
contains=20
derivations of the Linux kernel, relies on the WSL re-implementation of Lin=
ux kernel syscalls,=20
and facilitates the use of and enhances Linux-based goods, all within the t=
erms of the=20
Linux Sublicense Agreement.

We obtained a valid Sublicense Agreement for the use of the Linux trademark=
 for WLinux=20
from the Linux Foundation before launching WLinux. All of our intellectual =
property=20
compliance disclosures are here:=20
https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/WLinux/blob/master/LICENSE.md

> The situation strikes me as harmful to the kernel as the majority of folk=
s being=20
introduced to "Linux" this way will be tricked into thinking they're using/=
supporting Linux.

Users who purchase WLinux from the Microsoft Store are supporting the Linux=
 ecosystem=20
and free software generally. Everyone working on WLinux are Windows and Lin=
ux users
who are committed to making the Linux software ecosystem accessible to as m=
any people=20
as possible regardless of what device or operating system they are on. WLin=
ux and WSL=20
generally opens up new possibilities for bringing people to the Linux ecosy=
stem,=20
cross-platform development, and expanding access to free software and free =
software=20
development tools.=20

WLinux builds in a number of value-added enhancements and features, we prov=
ide=20
end user support, and work with various developer communities and other ope=
n source=20
companies to try to make it easy to get into the Linux ecosystem from Windo=
ws 10.  We=20
make it easy to get up and running with Go, Ruby, other dev toolchains, soo=
n Docker, install=20
various editors, configure predictive text input for non-Latin input, and i=
mplement a handful=20
of other tweaks to defaults. I personally do not believe a frontend dev ste=
pping into Linux=20
should have to know how to partition and dual-boot a system, or even have t=
o learn Docker,=20
to get started using node.js and trying different packages off npm. They wi=
ll get to that.

Many WLinux users are going to end up working on traditional server Linux e=
ventually,=20
if they don't already, as many of our users seem to work in hybrid environm=
ents as it is.=20
I imagine a few will end up trying and then switching to desktop Linux, aga=
in if they don't=20
use it already. But desktop Linux is just one small part of Linux, WLinux i=
s not here to=20
replace it, and WSL is not capable of doing so in it's current limitations.=
 Users are not being
 'tricked'. Free upstream distros from Canonical, Debian, SuSE, and Kali ar=
e available where=20
you can implement our tweaks and custom packages manually. Of the many copi=
es we have
 sold we have only had two refund requests which we have promptly honored. =
Users always=20
have the option of building WLinux from source using instructions we provid=
e. WLinux is also=20
heavily discounted or free in many less developed countries.

We turn the funds WLinux earns around to hire open source developers, spons=
or bug and=20
feature bounties, donate to upstream projects, and cover overhead. We are p=
rofitable and=20
expect to pay out over $2,000 USD in bounties this month alone after being =
on the store for
 just six weeks. We are focused on building a sustainable commercial open s=
ource project=20
that can direct our own development resources where we see fit to improve t=
he Linux=20
experience on WSL for us, the users of Linux on WSL. Microsoft has had abso=
lutely zero=20
input into how we have evolved WLinux besides open source code of theirs we=
 have used.
