Ah, good point!  Right that the master could be the the one that later
fails to round up.

Would it look less odd if I write it like this?

if (kgdb_info[cpu].enter_kgdb == 0)
  kgdb_info[cpu].task = NULL;

In general, though, "enter_kgdb" looks to be more of a boolean value
then a true counter.  The only place that modifies "enter_kgdb" is
kgdb_cpu_enter(). It increments it upon entry to the function and
decrements it upon exit.  All the callers to kgdb_cpu_enter() confirm
that "enter_kgdb" is 0 before calling it.  I'll further note that
kgdb_cpu_enter() unconditionally clobbers things like
"kgdb_info[cpu].debuggerinfo" upon entry.

I could add a patch that converts "enter_kgdb" to a true boolean if
that helps, though at this point I'm getting pretty far afield of my
original purpose of trying to fix the problem lockdep yelled about.
:-P  ...and I probably need to get back to my day job.

I'd also note that the other bits of code around here look pretty
unconditional to me, but my kdb/kgdb knowledge is not very strong (as
you've seen) so I could be wrong.  We are unconditionally clearing
bits from the "exception_state", unconditionally turning tracing on,
unconditionally calling correct_hw_break(), etc.  ...hmmmm, I suppose
it could look less odd if I moved my unconditional bit to be up a
little higher.  I could put it up above to the unconditional clearing
of "exception_state"  ;-P

OK, so I _think_ the answer here is to just get rid of the code from
kdb_debugger.c and rely on my new code.

Specifically I'd rather CPUs clear their own "kgdb_info" so we don't
need to worry about races where a CPU rounds up really late at some
time when we're not expecting it.  ...and once CPUs always clear its
own "kgdb_info" when exiting we don't need any special case code to
have the master try to clear state of offline CPUs.  Thanks for
pointing me to this code to get rid of.

---

So the tl;dr:

1. Though I'm 99% certain that "enter_kgdb" is truly a bool that is
either 0 or 1, I won't write a patch to change this myself in the
hopes that I can wrap up this patch series.  I'll add a note in my CL
description indicating that I believe things are safe because
"enter_kgdb" is really a bool.

2. I will add clearing of "debuggerinfo".

3. I will add the same clearing of "task" and "debuggerinfo" to when
the master exits.  I won't try to unify the code in my patch and leave
that for a future person working on this code.

4. To make it look less odd, I'll move my clearing to above the
"kgdb_info[cpu].exception_state &=" line.  It doesn't really matter
and why not make it look less odd?

5. I will remove the clearing of "debuggerinfo" and "task" from
kdb_stub() since it will no longer be needed.


...and again, thank you for all your timely and awesome reviews and
advice here.  It is certainly appreciated.


-Doug
