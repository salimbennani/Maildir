Sure, you can't *force* OEMs to supply a given ACPI device, but you
can certainly say "if you want this functionality, supply INT3401
devices."  That's what you do with PNP0A03 (PCI host bridges), for
example.  If an OEM doesn't supply PNP0A03 devices, the system can
boot just fine as long as you don't need PCI.

This model of using the PCI IDs forces OS vendors to release updates
for every new platform.  I guess you must have considered that and
decided whatever benefit you're getting was worth the cost.

You can add new features in ACPI devices just as well as with PCI
enumeration.

This started because I suggested that AMD was making work for
themselves by exposing more topology detail than necessary, which
means they have to change amd_nb.c and add PCI IDs to k10temp.c to
accommodate new platforms.

And it looks like Intel is doing the same thing by moving from a model
where some platform specifics can be encapsulated in ACPI methods so a
new platform doesn't force an OS release, to a model where new
platforms require OS driver updates.

Obviously I don't know all the new features you're planning, so I'll
stop pushing on this and wasting your time.
