I missed this response due to some problem in my mail client and re-iterated
some of the same points again on the V2 (https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/11/8/734).
My apologies for the same.

Right although I doubt that we could ever have a common check_fw_numa_topology()
check as the semantics for the table and individual entries there in for DT and
ACPI might be different. But I agree what you are saying.

Agreed, it has down sides.

Okay, we should remove them instead.

Okay. Anyways I had some other comments related to semantics checking at
the OF driver level but I can probably send them out as a separate patch
later. Once again it was my bad to miss this response in the first place.
