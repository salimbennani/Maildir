Yes, that's very informative, thank you very much.

Given the complexity of the driver and the non-obviousness of some
workarounds to "unfortunate hardware design choices", I think [some of]
this explanation should be committed together with the driver, in order
to make it more understandable to other people. Even more since you've
already taken time to write it.

Thanks,
