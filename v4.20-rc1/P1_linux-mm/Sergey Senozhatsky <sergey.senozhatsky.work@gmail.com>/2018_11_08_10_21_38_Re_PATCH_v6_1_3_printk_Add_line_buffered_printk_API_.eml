Right, so this is where things go a bit shady. I'll try to explain.

What is the problem:
- we have tons of CPUs, with tons of tasks running on them, with preemption,
  and interrupts, and potentially printk-s coming from various
  contexts/CPUs/tasks etc. so one 'cont' buffer is not enough.

What is the proposed solution:
- if 1 is not enough then 16 will do. And if 16 is not enough then this
  is not our problem anymore, it's a kernel misconfiguration and users'
  fault.

So, maybe it is a "common" kernel development pattern, I really don't know;
but it looks like we are just throwing the issue over the fence; and atop
of that we are killing off the existing 'cont'.

Let's have one more look at what we will fix and what we will break.

'cont' has premature flushes.

- it's annoying in some cases
- it's good otherwise

  Why is it good.
  It preserves the correct order of events.

  pr_cont("calling foo->init()....");
  foo->init()
   printk("Can't allocate buffer\n");    // premature flush
  pr_cont("...blah\h");

 Will end up in the logbuf as:
 [12345.123] calling foo->init()....
 [12345.124] Can't allocate buffer
 [12345.125] ...blah

 Where buffered printk will endup as:
 [12345.123] Can't allocate buffer
 [12345.124] calling foo->init().......blah

It's very different.

Not to mention that buffered printk does not flush on panic.
So, frankly, as of now, I don't see buffered printk as a 'cont'
replacement.

If our problem is OOM and lockdep print outs, then let's address only
those two; let's not "fix" the rest of the kernel, especially the early
boot, - we can break more things than we can mend.

[..]

Right, I saw it. We have similar points; I raised those in private talks:

- we don't need buffered printk in printk_safe/printk_nmi

- we don't need br_cont()

- unlike 'cont' buffer there is no way for us to flush buffered printk
  buffers on panic

- I don't exactly like the completely of the vprintk_buffered. If
  buffered printk is for single line, then it must be for single
  line only. And I'm not buying the "we will need this for printk
  origin info injection" argument.
  Linus was very clear about this whole idea:

  :   harder to read.

  So the "we need all that complexity to inject printk info in later
  patches" push doesn't look right.

- It seems that buffered printk attempts to solve too many problems.
  I'd prefer it to address just one.
