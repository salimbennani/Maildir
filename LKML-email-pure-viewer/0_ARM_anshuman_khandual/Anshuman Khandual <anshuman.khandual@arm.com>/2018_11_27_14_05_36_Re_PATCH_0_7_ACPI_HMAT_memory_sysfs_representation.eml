That a moving application can really benefit from a complete set of effective
N1 ----> N2 memory attributes ? Now mbind() binds the memory locally and
sched_setaffinity() binds the task locally. Even if the task gets to required
memory through mbind() a complete set of memory attributes as seen from
various nodes will help it create appropriate cpumask_t for sched_setaffinity().
Only local node effective attributes (as proposed by this series) wont be able
to give enough information to create required cpu mask.

But we hope that will change going forward as more and more heterogeneous
systems comes in. We should not be locking down an ABI without considering
for future system possibilities and task's requirements.

I would agree with you completely if we just want to move ahead in the
direction of preserving existing status quo. But this series does propose
an application interface (rightly so IMHO) for memory attributes and hence
we are just trying to figure out if that is the correct direction or not.

As we have been discussing on the other thread what has to be exported
should be derived from what all is needed. Cherry picking minimal set
of attributes and exposing them through sysfs in the short term does
not seem to be the right way either.

There is also a risk with a insufficient and in-extensible sysfs interface
which is going to be there for ever.

All of the memory visible in kernel is accessible from each individual CPU
on the system irrespective which node they belong. Unless there is another
type of memory accessors like GPU cores or something each node with CPU
should be an initiator for each node with memory.

Once coherency enumeration (through initiator <---> memory target) is out
of the way would not the following simple new interface be sufficient to
query platform about it's properties ?

The discussion on the other thread has some new details from last week.
