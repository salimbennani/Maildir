To bring the threads back together, Logan confirmed this.

That's certainly making sense to me as well.  Are we going to have issues
with backwards compatibility though?  It'll be fiddly to expose the existing
portdrv interface if this is reworked.  Probably possible though.

For some of the devices I'm looking at eating up functions is also
controversial :) They have an embedded switch and a 'lot' of functions.

People don't like spilling into additional bus numbers as that space is
also limited, so if you eat one of the 256 ARI functions they get annoyed.

One somewhat nasty trick might be to define a config space header
that tells you 'where' to find the PMU for a given port.  Pretty
much what MSIX does, but with the addition of a function number.

Down stream ports are trickier unless we assume their PMUs are in their
own bar space or that any reference to another function is one on the
upstream port.

There may also be advantages to doing it the other way around and have
the PMU function hold the cross referencing to the ports.  A port could
hold a reference to itself if it was all nicely integrated in the port
funciton.

Of course, another hardware design would have a unified counting system
for all downstream ports so describing that one is tricky as well.

Anyhow, that's a long term question and needs a lot of detailing filling in.

I think we'd have to define a new HISIXXXX ID instead as it won't bind a
platform driver to a PCI device.  The explicit structure of the PCIe bus
representation would go as well.

That's not really a problem, but still feels somewhat ugly given this
really is a PCIe device as these counters are reflecting the traffic
through the Port.  Having that port represented in two places is a bit ugly
but not unheard of.  SMMUV3 PMCG (the iommu counter) is only loosely tied
to the smmu it is counting on for example.

I don't really care which way we go on this particularly device, but
the problem will come back to bite us when the device is done entirely
on PCIe.

Agreed.

That might work.  Mark, Will what do you think? As long as you and Bjorn
agree I don't think it'll really matter which one is chosen.

driver/pci/pmu/ or drivers/perf/pci ?
