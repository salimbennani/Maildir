This is problematic. Any new kernel API interface should accommodate B2 type
memory as well from the above example which is on a PCIe bus. Because
eventually they would be represented as some sort of a NUMA node and then
applications will have to depend on this sysfs interface for their desired
memory placement requirements. Unless this interface is thought through for
B2 type of memory, it might not be extensible in the future.
