Yes and no.  While it is desirable to have a complete separation of  
the two parts as described above, we do live in a world that isn't  
perfect and we do need to compromise to maximise the benefit to all.   
See explanation below.

Let me pose the following scenario:  Say, the GPIO driver/API tell the  
PPS driver that both edges are indeed supported.  This then means that  
the PPS driver will blindly configure itself for returning data for  
both the ASSERT and DEASSERT edges of the PPS pulse.  However, say,  
the user only wants the ASSERT edge (as would be the case in most  
instances).  As the kernel currently stands, there is no way for the  
PPS driver to reconfigure itself after the pps_gpio_probe function  
exits.  This then means that you will automatically be servicing two  
interrupts per PPS cycle, even though the user only wants one (for PPS  
this is probably not a big deal...)

The reason for the PPS driver to have to blindly configure itself is  
that there is always going to be a delay between the driver being  
loaded and the userspace program becoming active and actually  
requesting what it wants.  On a modern x86 system this may be in the  
order of milliseconds, but on an embedded system this would be in the  
order of seconds as some systems load all configured modules at boot,  
before userspace gets control.

In the ideal case, it would be nice for the PPS driver to load and  
only configure itself after the time_pps_setparams function has been  
called by the user.

Here is the compromise:  It is usually the hardware vendor/integrator  
who has a good idea (hopefully) as to what capabilities are going to  
be used by the system.  Hence the devicetree would be the most logical  
place to put a flag that embodies the capabilities of the GPIO  
subsystem as well as the GPS or other peripheral device creating the  
PPS pulses.  To me, that is what capture_clear is.

Anyway, v11 of my patch now excludes all changes made previously to  
the capture_clear flag.
