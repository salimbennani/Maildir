My mistake, you're right. Tested and this does work with a module.

Unfortunately, the arrays they're assigned to in the wiphy is non-const:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/net/cfg80211.h#L4055
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/net/cfg80211.h#L346

struct ieee80211_supported_band *bands[IEEE80211_NUM_BANDS];

Good catch. Sorry about that, you pointed it out on an earlier version

I've redone the structure a bit to clean this up, and don't use the
lock here anymore.

Added a comment here, it looks like even with CFG80211_SIGNAL_TYPE_MBM
this should be in dBm.

Thanks, get_station and dump_station now both check if the device is connected.

Good catch, this was not a good strategy. I think it was stable for me
only because RTNL is technically not held when the destructor is
invoked by netdev_run_todo, though I see now that's only because
netdev_run_todo is a special case with respect to the RTNL mutex so
interacting with it there seems like a bad idea.
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/core/dev.c#L8735

I've changed the asynchronous strategy: at a high level, it now sets
the device in a "down"/"being deleted" state to block any further
asynchronous requests, cancels pending delayed work operations, and
cleans up dangling callbacks the delayed work operations had committed
to doing. More functions are also now annotated with which locks
should already be held and which will be acquired and released. This
relies heavily on cancel_delayed_work_sync. My assumption here is that
cancel_delayed_work_sync puts the delayed work operations in a
definite "not running" state, and uses the return value to determine
if it needs to clean up any callbacks.

Worked around it for this implementation by sharing one wiphy across
all net_device instances. The module init and destroy now acquire the
rtnl mutex to init/destroy the wiphy as well as registering the rtnl
device type. The netdev setup is now more sane as the wiphy setup is
done ahead of time. The only downside is that multiple wifi devices
cannot scan simultaneously, so no great loss.

I've uploaded the new version here: https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/11/21/251
