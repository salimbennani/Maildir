Right. As I mentioned in an earlier email, this is hopefully laying the groundwork
for future evolution of the TCG vector operations and making use of the existing
functions first.

Certainly I'd be interested at looking at the hardfloat patches after this, since FP
performance is something that can offer enormous benefit to MacOS emulation.

As a newcomer to this code, it's not particularly easy to read. It strikes me that
one of the main improvements would be to switch over to using generated helper
templates rather than to make use of nested macros as in use currently.

Looking at your profiles above, the primary hotspot appears to be
helper_lookup_tb_ptr(). However as someone quite new to the TCG parts of QEMU, I
couldn't tell you whether or not this is to be expected.

Perhaps a question for Richard: what could we consider to be a "normal" backend when
looking at profiles in terms of recommended features to implement, and to get an idea
of what a typical profile should look like?

It would be interesting to compare with a similar workload profile on e.g. ARM to see
if there is anything obvious that stands out for PPC.


ATB,

Mark.
