This looks great.

I am not sure what is the plan proceeding from here.
Are you going to implement this feature with the unfinished patch you
mentioned to create reset_control backed by a GPIO?
I am willing to help.
If you have patch I can help testing it.
It will be easier to test the shared reset line on my side since the
board I am working now has this use case.

If you don't have time for this, I can work on it based on your WIP patch.
In that case could you please post the patch ?
I just want to make sure I am on the right direction solving this
without making duplicate efforts..

This plan to support shared reset line makes sense.
