This is really a PowerNV need. So, I can reshuffle the code and make=20
a direct link between the XiveSource and the XiveRouter models for sPAPR.
It's a small change. and reintroduce XiveFabric (or whatever name we choo=
se)=20
later before the PowerNV Xive and PSIHB model.=20

Yes. I agree. It's not the same thing at all.

exactly.

Yes. XiveNotifier may be ? to use a noun and not a verb.

What the XIVE engines are doing is forwarding a trigger event to the=20
next engine that can possibly do the routing to the final target.=20
 =20
In the specs, the verbs 'trigger', 'forward', 'notify', 'route' are=20
commonly used. I think 'notify' is the most frequent.

ok for 'notify'.
