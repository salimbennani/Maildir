This is largely correct, except that we only program the interrupt for
events that we would not naturally stop at during the course of
execution such as asynchronous signals or context switch points. At
events that we would naturally stop at (i.e. we can stop at syscalls
via ptrace) we simply check that the counters match to find any
discrepancies faster, before they affect an async signal delivery.
Let's say I have the following event sequence:

1. alarm syscall at rbc=1000
2. SIGALARM delivery at rbc=8000
3. exit syscall at rbc=9000

During replay, we begin the program and run to the syscall via a
PTRACE_SYSCALL ptrace. When the replayed process stops, we check that
the value of the rbc counter is 1000 (we also check that all registers
match what we recorded) and then we emulate the effects of the syscall
on the replayed process's registers and memory.

Then we see that the next event is an asynchronous signal, and we
program the rbc counter to interrupt after an additional (8000 - 1000
- SKID_SIZE) events (where SKID_SIZE has been chosen by
experimentation to ensure that the PMU interrupt is not delivered
*after* the point in the program we care about. For Skylake this value
is 100). We then resume the program with a PTRACE_CONT ptrace and wait
for the PMI to stop the replayed tracee. We advance the program to the
exact point that we care about through a combination of breakpoints
and singlestepping, and then deliver the SIGALARM.

Once that is done, we see that the next event is the exit syscall, and
we again do a PTRACE_SYSCALL ptrace to get to it. Once there we check
the rbc counter value and registers match what were recorded, and
perform the syscall.

Our counters are always restricted to ring 3 in both recording and replay.
