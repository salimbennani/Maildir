I guess that really depends on your platform (which is why EAS is using
an Energy Model BTW, it's pretty hard to find one heuristic that works
well for all topologies out there). But your example is a bit unfair I
think. You should compare 1 CPU at 1GHz vs 4 CPUs at 250MHz. Otherwise
you're not resourcing the tasks adequately in one of the cases.

Right, I'm certainly not advocating for a race-to-idle policy here. What
I'm saying is that, if you can avoid to raise the OPP by spreading, it's
often a good thing from an energy standpoint, because as you said the
dynamic energy is generally the most expensive part. But even if you can
pack the tasks on a single CPU without having to raise the OPP, it's not
obvious this is the right thing to do either since that will prevent you
from going cluster idle (or reduce the time you _could_ spend cluster
idle at least).

That kind of packing vs spreading energy assessment is really hard to
do in general, especially without knowing the costs of running at
different idle states.

OK I see :-)

Ah, that's interesting ... If there are tasks in Android that we really
don't care about (that is it's actually fine to starve them), then maybe
we should put those in SCHED_IDLE indeed ... That'll leave the stage for
the other tasks that do have stronger requirements.

So yeah, I agree it's worth investigating.

Right so my overall advice would be to try an avoid to hard-code a pure
packing heuristic like that (unless you have loads of numbers to backup
the idea and show it works well), but perhaps to use the policy of the
tasks to try and break the tie between CPU candidates that cannot be
differentiated otherwise because the other metrics (load / utilization)
are roughly equivalent).

We really ought to make sure, however, that we have a strong use case
for SCHED_IDLE tasks in Android or elsewhere first before adding any
kind infrastructure for it.

Anyways, just my two cents ...

I hope that's useful :-)

Thanks,
Quentin
