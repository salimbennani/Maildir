It does unless the code lies about what the hardware do :) See umem_odp.c
in core and odp.c in mlx5 directories.

So this patchset is about mm plumbings, what fs does before mm code
gets call is a fs discussion. Note also that GUP is always against
a virtual address of a process. GUP is use by few driver to allow
the device direct access to some portion of process address space.

The issues is that some of those device have designed an API that
fully ignore things like munmap, splice, truncate, ... and as such
they open the door for undefined behavior. I believe the original
intention in all the cases was that the user would not do stupid
thing like setup the device mapping through device specific API and
then munmap or truncate or anything that would affect the range of
virtual address.

Thing is from kernel point of view we should not and can not assume
that userspace will behave properly. So we have to brace for the
worst. Which is what this patchset is trying to do ie fix some of
issues and make the rest of them explicit to device driver so that
they can decide what to do about it.

My advice is for each of those sub-system/device to fail loudly
when such thing happens so that the user knows he is doing something
stupid or illegal.

In above code at the comment point the driver garanty the hardware
will never use the old dma address any more ie that all in flight
dma are done. I know this can be done for some devices. It might
very well not work for all and this is why this need to be a sub-
system/device discussion.
