Yes you must torn down mapping before returning from mmu notifier
call back. Any time after is too late. You obviously need hardware
that can support that. In the infiniband sub-system AFAIK only the
mlx5 hardware can do that. In the GPU sub-system everyone is fine.

Dunno about other sub-systems.

If hardware can not do that then hardware should not use GUP, at
least not on file back page. I advocated in favor of forbiding GUP
for device that can not do that as right now this silently breaks
in few cases (truncate, mremap, splice, reflink, ...). So the device
in those cases can end up with GUPed pages that do not correspond
to anything anymore ie they do not correspond to the memory backing
the virtual address they were GUP against, nor they correspond to
the file content at the given offset anymore. It is just random
data as far as the kernel or filesystem is concern.

Of course for this to happen you need an application that do stupid
thing like create an MR in one thread on the mmap of a file and
truncate that same file in another thread (or from the same thread).

So this is unlikely to happen in sane program. It does not mean it
will not happen.


The second set of issue at to deals with set_page_dirty happening
long time after page_release did happens and thus the fs dirty
page callback will see page in bad state and will BUG() and you
will have an oops and loose any data your device might have written
to the page. This is highly filesystem dependend and also timing
dependend and link to thing like memory pressure so it might not
happen that often but again it can happen.

I am not saying reuse the DMA address in the emergency_mean_callback
the idea was:

    gup_page_emergency_revoke(device, page)
    {
        crapy_page = alloc_page();
        dma_addr = dma_map(crappy_page, device, ...);
        mydevice_page_table_update(device, crappy_page, dma_addr);
        mydevice_tlb_flush(device);
        mydevice_wait_pending_dma(device)

        // at this point the original GUPed page is not access by hw

        dma_unmap(page);
        put_user_page(page);
    }

I know that it is something we can do with GPU devices. So i assumed
that other devices can do that to. But i understand this is highly
device dependent. Not that if you have a command queue it is more like:

    gup_page_emergency_revoke(device, page)
    {
        crapy_page = alloc_page();
        dma_addr = dma_map(crappy_page, device, ...);

        // below function update kernel side data structure that stores
        // the pointer to the GUPed page and that are use to build cmds
        // send to the hardware. It does not update the hardware, just
        // the device driver internal data structure.
        mydevice_replace_page_in_object(device, page, crappy_page, dma_addr);

        mydevice_queue_wait_pending_job(device);

        // at this point the original GUPed page is not access by hw and
        // any new command will be using the crappy page not the GUPed
        // page

        dma_unmap(page);
        put_user_page(page);
    }

Again if device can not do any of the above then it should really not
be using GUP because they are corner case that are simply not solvable.
We can avoid kernel OOPS but we can not pin the page as GUP user believe
ie the virtual address the GUP happened against can point to a different
page (true for both anonymous memory and file back memory).


The put_user_page() patchset is about solving the OOPS and BUG() and
also fixing the tiny race that exist for direct I/O. Fixing other user
of GUP should happen sub-system by sub-system and each sub-system or
device driver maintainer must choose their poison. This is what i am
advocating for. If the emergency_revoke above is something that would
work for device is something i can't say for certain, only for devices
i know (which are GPU mostly).
