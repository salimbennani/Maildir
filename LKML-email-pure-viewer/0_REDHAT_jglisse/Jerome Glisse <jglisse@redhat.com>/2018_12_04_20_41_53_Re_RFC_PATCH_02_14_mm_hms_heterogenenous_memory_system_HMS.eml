Discussion with Logan convinced me to use a mask for property like:
    - cache coherent
    - persistent
    ...

Then files for other properties like:
    - bandwidth (bytes/s)
    - latency
    - granularity (size of individual access or bus width)
    ...

I have given examples of how application looks today and how they
transform with HMS in my email exchange with Dave Hansen. I will
add them to the documentation and to the cover letter in my next
posting.

I will switch to one simple call for each individual action (policy and
migration).

They are have been patchset in the past to exclude node from allocation
last time i check they all were rejected and people felt it was not a
good thing to do.

Also IIRC adding more node might be problematic as i think we do not
have many bits left inside the flags field of struct page. Right now
i do not believe in moving device memory as generic node inside the
linux kernel because for many folks that will just be a waste, people
only doing desktop and not using their GPU for compute will never get
a good usage from that. Graphic memory allocation is wildely different
from compute allocation which is more like CPU one.

So converting graphic driver to register their memory as node does
not seems as a good idea at this time. I doubt the GPU folks upstream
would accept that (with my GPU hat ons i would not).

The existing topology interface is not use today for that memory
and people in GPU world do not see it as an interface that can be
use. See above discussion about GPU memory. This is the raison
d'être of this proposal. A new way to expose heterogeneous memory
to userspace.

Application have an OpenCL context from the context it gets the
device initiator unique id from the device initiator unique id
it looks at all the links and bridge the initiator is connected
to. Which gives it a list of links it can order that list using
bandwidth first and latency second (ie 2 link with same bandwidth
will be order with the one with slowest latency first). It goes
over that list from best to worse and for each links it looks at
what target are also connected to that link. From that it build
an ordered list of targets. It also only pick cache coherent
memory in that list.

It now use this ordered list of targets to set policy or migrate
its buffer to the best memory. Kernel will first try to use the
first target, if it runs out of that memory it will use the next
target ... so on and so forth.


This can all be down inside a userspace common helper library for
ease of use. More advance application will do finer allocation
for instance they will partition their dataset using the access
frequency. Most accessed dataset in the application will use
the fastest memory (which is likely to be somewhat small ie
few GigaBytes), while dataset that are more sparsely accessed
will be push to use slower memory (but they are more of it).


> 2. Allocator in OpenCL application is looking for memory to share

Same process as above, starts from initiator id, build links
list then build all target that initiator can access. Then
order that list according to the property of interest to the
application (bandwidth, latency, ...). Once it has the target
list it can use either policy or migration. Policy if it is
for a new allocation, migration if it is to migrate an existing
buffer to memory that is more appropriate for the OpenCL device
under use.


> 3. Storage application is looking for larger but slower memory
> for CPU usage.

Application build a list of initiator corresponding to the CPU
it is using (bind too). From that list of initiator it builds
a list of links (considering bridge too). From the list of links
it builds a list of target (connected to those links).

Then it order the list of target by size (not by latency or
bandwidth). Once it has an ordered list of target then it use
either the policy or migrate API for the range of virtual
address it wants to affect.

> Please work out some use cases like this.

Note that above all the list building in userspace is intended
to be done by an helper library as this is really boiler plate
code. The last patch in my serie have userspace helpers to
parse the sysfs, i will grow that into a mini library with example
to show case it.

More example from other part of this email thread:

High level overview of how one application looks today:

    1) Application get some dataset from some source (disk, network,
       sensors, ...)
    2) Application allocate memory on device A and copy over the dataset
    3) Application run some CPU code to format the copy of the dataset
       inside device A memory (rebuild pointers inside the dataset,
       this can represent millions and millions of operations)
    4) Application run code on device A that use the dataset
    5) Application allocate memory on device B and copy over result
       from device A
    6) Application run some CPU code to format the copy of the dataset
       inside device B (rebuild pointers inside the dataset,
       this can represent millions and millions of operations)
    7) Application run code on device B that use the dataset
    8) Application copy result over from device B and keep on doing its
       thing

How it looks with HMS:
    1) Application get some dataset from some source (disk, network,
       sensors, ...)
    2-3) Application calls HMS to migrate to device A memory
    4) Application run code on device A that use the dataset
    5-6) Application calls HMS to migrate to device B memory
    7) Application run code on device B that use the dataset
    8) Application calls HMS to migrate result to main memory

So we now avoid explicit copy and having to rebuild data structure
inside each device address space.


Above example is for migrate. Here is an example for how the
topology is use today:

    Application knows that the platform is running on have 16
    GPU split into 2 group of 8 GPUs each. GPU in each group can
    access each other memory with dedicated mesh links between
    each others. Full speed no traffic bottleneck.

    Application splits its GPU computation in 2 so that each
    partition runs on a group of interconnected GPU allowing
    them to share the dataset.

With HMS:
    Application can query the kernel to discover the topology of
    system it is running on and use it to partition and balance
    its workload accordingly. Same application should now be able
    to run on new platform without having to adapt it to it.
