I gave an example in an email in this thread:

https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1821872.html

Is the kind of example you are looking for ? :)

Yes discoverable bus like PCIE and all its derivative (CCIX, OpenCAPI,
...) userspace will have way to find the topology. The issue lies with
orthogonal topology of extra bus that are not necessarily enumerated
or with a device driver presently and especially how they inter-act
with each other (can you cross them ? ...)

From my point of view we want to give the best case sticker value to
userspace ie the bandwidth the engineer that designed the bus sworn
their hardware deliver :)

I believe it the is the best approximation we can deliver.

I don't think this should be a criteria, kernel is not using GPU or
network adatper to browse the web for itself (at least i hope the
linux kernel is not selfaware ;)). So this kind of topology is not
of big use to the kernel. Kernel will only care about CPU and memory
that abide to the memory model of the platform. It will also care
about more irregular CPU inter-connected ie CPUs on the same mega
substrate likely have a faster inter-connect between them then to
the ones in a different physical socket. NUMA distance can model
that. Dunno if more than that would be useful to the kernel.

> 2) Its going to do something automatic with it.

The information is intended for userspace for application that use
that information. Today application get that information from non
standard source and i would like to provide this in a standard
common place in the kernel for few reasons:
    - Common model with explicit definition of what is what and
      what are the rules. No need to userspace to understand the
      specificities of various kernel sub-system.
    - Define unique identifiant for _every_ type of memory in the
      system even device memory so that i can define syscall to
      operate on those memory (can not do that in device driver)
    - Integrate with core mm so that long term we can move more
      of individual device memory management into core component.

> 3) It needs to fix garbage info or supplement with things only the kernel knows.

Yes kernel is expect to fix the informations it get and sanitize
it so that userspace do not have to grow database of quirk and
workaround. Moreover kernel can also benchmark inter-connect and
adapt reported bandwidth and latency if this is ever something
people would like to see.


I will post two v2 where i split the common helpers from the sysfs
and syscall part. I need the common helpers today in the case of
single device and have user for that code (nouveau and amdgpu for
starter). I want to continue the sysfs and syscall discussion and
i need to reformulate thing and give better explaination of why
i think the way i am doing thing have more values than any other.

Dunno if i will have time to finish rework-ing all this before the
end of this year.

Cheers,
Jérôme
