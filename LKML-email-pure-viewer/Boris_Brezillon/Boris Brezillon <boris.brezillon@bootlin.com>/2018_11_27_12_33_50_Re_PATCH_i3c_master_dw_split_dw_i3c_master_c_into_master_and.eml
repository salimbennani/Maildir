I think you didn't read my reply carefully. I'm not saying I3C == USB,
I'm just saying that the way you interact with an I3C from a SW PoV is
not at all the same as you would do for an I2C device. Do you deny that?

Looks like there's a misunderstanding here. The question is not whether
I3C will replace I2C or USB, of course it's meant to overcome the
limitations of I2C. I'm just pointing out that, if we have to expose
I3C devices, we should look at what other discoverable buses do (PCI,
USB, ...), not what I2C does.

There's a difference between a secondary master that waits for its time
to become the currrent master, and a secondary master that provides I3C
device features when it's acting as a slave (sensor, GPIO
controller, ...). So far we focused on supporting the former. If
there's a need for the latter, then we should start thinking about the
slave framework...

Can you detail a bit more what you have in mind? I don't think we can
do like I2C, simply because we need to expose a valid DCR +
manuf-ID/PID so that other masters can bind the device to the
appropriate driver on their side. Plus, if we're about to expose
generic profiles, we likely don't want each I3C slave controller driver
to do that on its own.

If we mix everything in the same subdir, I'd like to have an easy way
to quickly identify those that are slave controllers and those that are
master controllers. For the dual-role thing, maybe we can consider them
as master (ones with advances slave features).

Would you be okay with drivers/i3c/controllers/{designware,dw}/..., so
that you can have all designware drivers (for both slave and master
blocks) in the same dir?

For those that are placed directly under drivers/i3c/controllers/...
(because they only have one .c file), I'd like to keep a standard
prefix.

And again, I'm questioning the necessity of per-IP directories at the
root level. I'm not against per-IP directories, as long as they are
classified like other HW blocks: drivers/i3c/{master,slave}/<ip>/...

No it's not vain, it's how we do discuss things in the community. I'm
not saying I'm always right, but I need to understand the problems
you're trying to solve to take a decision, and I don't think you
initially gave all the details I needed to understand your PoV. That's
a bit clearer now, even if I still disagree on a few aspects.

They will come.

Come on! All I've seen so far are complaints on tiny details, it
definitely doesn't prevent you from adding new features.
