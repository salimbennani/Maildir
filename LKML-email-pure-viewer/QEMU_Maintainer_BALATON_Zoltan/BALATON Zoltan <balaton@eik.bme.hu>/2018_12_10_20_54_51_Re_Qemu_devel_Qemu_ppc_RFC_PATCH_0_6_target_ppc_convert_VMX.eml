Tried it on i5 650 which has: sse sse2 ssse3 sse4_1 sse4_2. I assume 
x86_64 should be supported but not sure what are the CPU requirements.

Yes, I don't really know what these tests use but I think "lame" test is 
mostly floating point but tried with "lame_vmx" which should at least use 
some vector ops and "mplayer -benchmark" test is more vmx dependent based 
on my previous profiling and testing with hardfloat but I'm not sure. 
(When testing these with hardfloat I've found that lame was benefiting 
from hardfloat but mplayer wasn't and more VMX related functions showed up 
with mplayer so I assumed it's more VMX bound.)

I've tried to do some profiling again to find out what's used but I can't 
get good results with the tools I have (oprofile stopped working since 
I've updated my machine and Linux perf provides results that are hard to 
interpret for me, haven't tried if gprof would work now it didn't before) 
but I've seen some vector related helpers in the profile so at least some 
vector ops are used. The "helper_vperm" came up top at about 11th (not 
sure where is it called from), other vector helpers were lower.

I don't remember details now but previously when testing hardfloat I've 
written this: "I've looked at vperm which came out top in one of the 
profiles I've taken and on little endian hosts it has the loop backwards 
and also accesses vector elements from end to front which I wonder may be 
enough for the compiler to not be able to optimise it? But I haven't 
checked assembly. The altivec dependent mplayer video decoding test did 
not change much with hardfloat, it took 98% compared to master so likely 
altivec is dominating here." (Although this was with the PPC specific 
vector helpers before VMX patch so not sure if this is still relevant.)

The top 10 in profile were still related to low level memory access and 
MMU management stuff as I've found before:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-07/msg03609.html
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-07/msg03704.html

I think implementing i2c for mac99 may help this and some other 
optimisations may also be possible but I don't know enough about these to 
try that.

It also looks like with --enable-debug something is always flusing tlb and 
blowing away tb caches so these will be top in profile and likely dominate 
runtime so can't really use profile to measure impact of VMX patch. 
Without --enable-debug I can't get call graphs so can't get useful 
profile. I think I've looked at this before as well but can't remember now 
which check enabled by --enable-debug is responsible for constant tb 
cache flush and if that could be avoided. I just don't use --enable-debug 
since unless need to debug somthing.

Maybe the PPC softmmu should be reviewed and optimised by someone who 
knows it...

BALATON Zoltan
