Device emulation is the core of what GPL QEMU does.  Mechanisms for
out-of-tree device emulation get rejected because they are likely to be
misused by parties who do not wish to contribute to QEMU.

That would result in the QEMU community maintaining infrastructure for
third parties who ship code of questionable quality and profit from it.
That's not healthy for the QEMU community and there's no incentive to
allow it.

A bit more about specifics you mentioned:

vhost-user is an exception for vhost devices.  They are based on the
open VIRTIO specification.  QEMU has in-tree implementations of these
devices so users can fall back to them if they need to request support
(otherwise it's impossible to support users with third-party devices).

Generic out-of-tree PCI device emulation is way too big a loophole.  The
QEMU community cannot support users who run arbitrary third-party PCI
devices.

The fact that there are ways to get around this by writing software mdev
devices doesn't mean it makes sense for QEMU to open a loophole itself.
