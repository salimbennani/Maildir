The first email in this thread contains benchmark results showing that
optimized SeaBIOS is comparable to qboot, so it does not offer anything
unique with respect to boot time.

We're trying to focus on SeaBIOS because it's actively maintained and
already shipped by distros.  Relying on qboot will make it harder to get
PVH into the hands of users because distros have to package and ship
qboot first.  This might also require users to change their QEMU
command-line syntax to benefit from fast kernel booting.

I would strongly recommend looking at the SeaBIOS -kernel approach and
avoiding QEMU command-line changes.  That way -kernel becomes fast for
users as soon as they upgrade their QEMU without requiring configuration
changes.

If you have questions about how the -kernel boot works with SeaBIOS,
Stefano can help explain it and share details of his
development/benchmarking environment (see also earlier mails in this
email thread).

Right.  Collaboration with Firecracker is more in the interest of
avoiding duplication and making it easy for users to fast boot a single
kernel (thanks to a common ABI like PVH) on any hypervisor.
