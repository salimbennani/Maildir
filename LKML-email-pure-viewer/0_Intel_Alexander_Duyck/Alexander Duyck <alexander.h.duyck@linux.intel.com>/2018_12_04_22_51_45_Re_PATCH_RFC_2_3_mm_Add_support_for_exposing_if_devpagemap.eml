Okay. I think I understand this somewhat now. So the page might be
physically there, but with the reserved bit it is not supposed to be
touched.

My main concern with just dropping the bit is that we start seeing some
other uses that I was not certain what the impact would be. For example
the functions like kvm_set_pfn_accessed start going in and manipulating
things that I am not sure should be messed with for a DAX page.

Right. The thing I am worried about is the cascade of secondary effects
that start kicking in because of us not setting the PageReserved bit.

So for example kvm_set_pfn_accessed can call mark_page_accessed. That
in turn takes a few calls to get into any issues as the first call will
leave the page as inactive, and set the referenced flag. The second
call to it is supposed to set the active flag but I am assuming that
won't happen due to the fact that we aren't supposed to touch LRU.
However, we are not a swap backed page so I suspect we will go through
workingset_activation() and I am not sure what the impact there will be
since I don't believe we have a memory cgroup associated with the DAX
pages do we?
