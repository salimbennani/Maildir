is that version tagging really needed? What changes do you envision with 
versions?

I liked the simplicity of keeping it outside all the existing memory 
management policy code. But that that is also the drawback isn't it?
We now have multiple entities tracking cpu and memory. (This reminded me 
of how we started with memcg in the early days).

Once we have these different types of targets, ideally the system should
be able to place them in the ideal location based on the affinity of the 
access. ie. we should automatically place the memory such that
initiator can access the target optimally. That is what we try to do 
with current system with autonuma. (You did mention that you are not 
looking at how this patch series will evolve to automatic handling of 
placement right now.) But i guess we want to see if the framework indeed 
help in achieving that goal. Having HMS outside the core memory
handling routines will be a road blocker there?
