Boot times compare very favorably to qemu-lite, since the end result is 
basically doing a very similar thing. For now, we are going with a QEMU 
+ qboot solution to introduce the PVH entry support in Qemu (meaning we 
will be posting Qemu and qboot patches and you will need both to boot an 
uncompressed kernel binary). As such we have numbers that Liam will 
include in the cover letter showing significant boot time improvement 
over existing QEMU + qboot approaches involving a compressed kernel 
binary. And as we all know, the existing qboot approach already gets 
boot times down pretty low.

Once the patches have been posted (soon) it would be great if some other 
folks could pick them up and run your own numbers on various test setups 
and comparisons you already have.

I haven't tried Firecracker, specifically. It would be good to see a 
comparison just so we know where we stand, but it's not terribly 
relevant to folks who want to continue using Qemu right? Meaning Qemu 
(and all solutions built on it like kata) still needs a solution for 
improving boot time regardless of what NEMU and Firecracker are doing.

And from what I've read so far, Firecracker only supports Linux guests. 
So one could arguably just bake in all sorts of Linux specific knowledge 
into it and have it lay things out like zero page right in the VMM code 
right?

I don't know off-hand, but is that how Firecracker boots an uncompressed 
Linux kernel? Anyone know?

Thanks,
