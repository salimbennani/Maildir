To be fair, what I'm saying is that the qboot + PVH approach saves a 
significant percentage of boot time as compared to qboot only. So it 
does provide an important improvement over both existing qboot as well 
as optimized SeaBIOS from what I can tell. Please see:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-12/msg00957.html
and
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-12/msg00953.html

But you do make a good point here about distribution and usability. 
Using qboot is just one way to take advantage of the PVH entry -- and 
the quickest way for us to get something usable out there for the 
community to look at and play with.

There are other ways to take advantage of the PVH entry for KVM guests, 
once the Linux changes are in place. So qboot is definitely not a hard 
requirement in the long run.
