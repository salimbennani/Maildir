I should clarify here.  When I say "floating point" above, I'm not
meaning things using the regular FPU instead of the vector unit.  I'm
saying *anything* involving floating point calculations whether
they're done in the FPU or the vector unit.

The patches here don't convert all VMX instructions to use vector TCG
ops - they only convert a few, and those few are about using the
vector unit for integer (and logical) operations.  VMX instructions
involving floating point calculations are unaffected and will still
use soft-float.

I'm not sure there is anyone who knows it at this point.  I probably
know it as well as anybody, and the ppc32 code scares me.  It's a
crufty mess and it would be nice to clean up, but that requires
someone with enough time and interest.
