When I saw this thread over the weekend I was going to reply to it and
raise this issue but Andy beat me to it.  Beyond that I was busy
trying to get enough firwewood ready to stay warm for the winter so
other priorities prevailed.. :-)

About 6-8 months ago, Andy and I had a lively discussion on this list
about whether or not there was a need, from a security perspective,
for enclave based LC.  I understand the sentiment against enclave
based LC, particularly with only a single vendor in control, but when
the entire spectrum of SGX security guarantees are considered, things
begin to fray at the edges a bit when LC is delegated to the kernel.

As everyone knows, in the most general sense, SGX is designed to
implement security in an IAGO threat environment, ie. where the entire
platform is compromised.  This is conceptually, if not provably
possible, when all of the security contracts are fulfilled by
enclaves.  Placing LC in the kernel has the effect of bringing the
kernel into the TCB footprint of the overall security guarantees the
technology is designed to deliver, which include privacy and
anonymity.

So, as Andy points out, we now need to work these security
considerations into the design of what will be 'the' Linux SGX driver.

Moving LC into the kernel means that rigid security controls are no
longer available for two security sensitive assets; The Provisioning
Key (PK) and the Provisioning Seal Key (PSK).

The PK is used to generate a unique Platform Provisioning IDentity
(PPID) in the Endpoint Selection (ES) phase of the Intel Enhanced
Privacy ID (EPID) provisioning protocol.  With the proposed driver, as
Andy notes above, there is now the opportunity for adversarial
generation of a unique platform identity by anyone who can create and
run an enclave.

The ENCLU[EGETKEY] instruction does not include the OWNEREPOCH values
in the key derivation process so the PK is in effect a permanent and
unique identity for a platform.

The PSK is one of the statically derived symmetric keys that are
available for sealing/encryption of data.  The PSK is used to encrypt
and protect the EPID private key that Intel provisions to a platform.
This private key is used by the quoting enclave to sign attestation
reports for enclaves running on the platform.  The SGX privacy
guarantees are a function of the security characteristics of EPID
keys.

So, loss of the PSK has implications with respect to the binding of an
EPID to a platform and what entities can use the EPID private key.  In
the enclave LC model the only entities with access to the key are the
provisioning (PVE) and quoting (QE) enclaves.

For the benefit of those not deeply involved in all this.  Shortly
after the release of the Linux SDK/PSW, Intel evolved the ability to
uniquely identify a platform and verify that an enclave is running on
a 'GenuineIntel' platform into the Platform Certification Enclave
(PCE).  This enclave has the provisioning attribute set and uses
access to the PK to implement this functionality.

Section 5.8.2 of the Costan and Devadas SGX review paper talk about
the PK and the PSK.  This section notes, in a referral to section
5.9.3, that restriction of general access to the PROVISION attribute
by enclaves is important for SGX privacy guarantees.

So I believe it is fair to state that this issue requires careful
consideration as we move the Linux SGX eco-system forward.

Malware would not necessarily need the Intel attestation service.
Once access to the PROVISION bit is available, malware teams could
simply build their own attestation service.

Malware authors are a bit limited now by the general design of the
Intel PSW that mediates all enclave platform functionality through the
aesm_service binary.  The group that I direct SGX engineering for,
IDfusion, developed a complete replacement for the Intel PSW.  Our
work is a minimum footprint implementation that focuses on the
application of SGX to intelligent network endpoint devices and
embedded environments.

Our PSW supports the generation of 'fat binaries' where all of the
functionality, including enclaves, can be embedded into a single
statically linked and self-contained binary.  We developed a proof of
concept application, based on the Apache Struts vulnerability, that
loads one of these binaries on a platform which then sets up a secured
and attested channel for spirting information off of the malware
target.

So the malware concerns are not theoretical, as we are not an
extraordinarily clever group of individuals.  We are considering an
open-source release of the tooling we have developed and even if we
don't end up doing that someone else could easily implement equivalent
functionality.

We've written at some length about these issues in the following Intel
SGX developer forum threads if anyone is interested:

https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-software-guard-extensions-intel-sgx/topic/781730

https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-software-guard-extensions-intel-sgx/topic/671517

From a hardware perspective, FLC has now emerged on the Xeon E series
of processors.  FLC isn't being deployed for the sake of openness or
the open-source community, it is rather, secondary to a vertical
marketing strategy that Intel is implementing for SGX.

Intel is offering a subscription based service for data-center
applications of SGX.  Attestation is based on an ECDSA secured
certification that the enclave is running on a 'GenuineIntel' platform
with a specific platform security version (PSVN), see the discussion
on the PCE enclave above.

Non server class, ie. workstations and embedded class devices, will
presumably use a provisioning and EPID based strategy.

Doing this right is probably going to take a bit more then two
separate device nodes.

I believe what the Linux community needs to do is to step back and
consider how to create a driver architecture that supports what will
be the certain stratification of SGX hardware.  I don't see the
current driver being useful for anything but data-center class
hardware for the intermediate if not foreseeable future.

In addition, given what was detailed above, I don't see how this
driver is going to be satisfactory for those of us delivering
platforms with stringent security and privacy guarantees that are
relevant in an IAGO model.  Like it or not the most stringent security
contracts are only available in a full enclave based model.

As a result, like it or not, the current driver needs the ability to
function in both launch control modes.

Hopefully the above information is useful to the development dialogue.

Developing a community driver is tedious at best, particularly for
hardware such as this.  Our personal thanks to Jarkko and others who
have been working through these issues.

Best wishes for a productive remainder of the week and for a pleasant
Thanksgiving holiday for those who will be celebrating that.
