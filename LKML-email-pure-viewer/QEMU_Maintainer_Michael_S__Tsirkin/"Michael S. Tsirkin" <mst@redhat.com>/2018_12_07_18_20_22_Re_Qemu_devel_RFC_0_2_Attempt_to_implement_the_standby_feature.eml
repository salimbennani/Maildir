I think what you say about using libosinfo to preserve PCI resources
is a very good idea.

I do however disagree with relying on it for correctness.

For example it seems very reasonable to only use virtio
during boot and then only enable a PT device once OS is active.

In short we need to minimise guest and management smarts required for
basic functionality.  What you propose seems to be going back to the
original ideas involving everything from guest firmware up to higher
level management stack. I don't see a problem with someone working on
such designs but it didn't happen in the 5 years since it was proposed
for Fedora.
