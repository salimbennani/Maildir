Yes. Indeed the pool can be seen as a list of physical addresses that:
 - are unused by other chips on the local bus
 - and given to the ser/des to use for the remote devices
 - will physycally appear on the local bus to talk to remote devices

Whether they are runtime translated or reprogrammed on the remode
devices is not much relevant for the local bus.

I don't foresee any problem in moving from a large pool at the
serializer to small pools at each port.
