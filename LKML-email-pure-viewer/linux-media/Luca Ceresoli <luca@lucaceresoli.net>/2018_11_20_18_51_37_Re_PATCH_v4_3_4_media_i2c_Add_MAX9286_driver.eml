Can the remote (max9271) translate addresses for transactions
originating from the local side? This would make it possible to do a
proper address translation, although 2 addresses is a quite small amount.

BTW all the TI chips I'm looking at can do address translation but, as
far as I understand, only when acting as "slave proxy", i.e. when
attached to the bus master. If the Maxim chips do the same, the "remote
translation" would be unusable.

Sadly, it looks pretty much unavoidable...

Indeed it would have been!

But hey, The FOSDEM CFPs are still open!
