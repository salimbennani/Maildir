I think that part of our disagreement is the whole "user reported"
criteria. Looking at myself as an example, unless I experience an
obvious corruption I can reproduce, I am most likely to just ignore it
and recreate the filesystem.

This is even more true for "enterprisy" workloads where data may be
replicated across multiple filesystems, and if one of these fails then
its just silently discarded and replaced.

User reports are hard to come by, not just for XFS but pretty much
anywhere else in the kernel. Our debugging/reporting story is almost as
bad as our QA ;)

A few times above you used the word "unlikely" to indicate that a bug
will never really be hit by real users. I strongly disagree with using
this guess to decide if we're going to backport anything or not. Every
time I meet with the FB folks I keep hearing how they end up hitting
"once in a lifetime" bugs over and over on their infrastructure.

Do we agree that the ideal solution would be backporting every fix, and
having a solid QA system to validate it? Obviously it's not going to
happen in the next year or two, but if we agree on the end goal then
there's no point in this continued arguing about the steps in between :)

One of the concerns I have about stable trees which we both share here
is that no one really uses Linus's tree: it's used as an integration
tree, but very few people actually test their workloads on it. Most
testing ends up hapenning, sadly enough, on stable trees. I see it as an
issue with our process for which I don't have an idea how to solve.

This is a case where theory collides with the real world. Yes, our QA is
lacking, but we don't have the option of not doing the current process.
If we stop backporting until a future data where our QA problem is
solved we'll end up with what we had before: users stuck on ancient
kernels without a way to upgrade.

With the current model we're aware that bugs sneak through, but we try
to deal with it by both improving our QA, and encouraging users to do
their own extensive QA. If we encourage users to update frequently we
can keep improving our process and the quality of kernels will keep
