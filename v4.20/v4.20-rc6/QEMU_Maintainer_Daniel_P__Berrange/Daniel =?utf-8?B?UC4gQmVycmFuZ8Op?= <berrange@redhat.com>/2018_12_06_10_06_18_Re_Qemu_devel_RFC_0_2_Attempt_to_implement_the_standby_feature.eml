Relying on F_STANDBY negotiation to decide whether to activate the VFIO
device is a bad idea. PCI devices are precious, so if the guest OS does
not support this standby feature, we must never add the VFIO device to
QEMU in the first place.

We have the libosinfo project which provides metadata on what features
different guest OS versions support. This can be used to indicate whether
a guest OS version supports the standby NIC concept and thus avoid needin=
g
to allocate PCI devices to guests that will never use them.

F_STANDBY is still useful as a flag to inform the guest OS that it should
pair up NICs with identical MACs, as opposed to configuring them separate=
ly.
It shouldn't be used to show/hide the device though, we should simply nev=
er
add the 2nd device if we know it won't be used by a given guest OS versio=
n.
