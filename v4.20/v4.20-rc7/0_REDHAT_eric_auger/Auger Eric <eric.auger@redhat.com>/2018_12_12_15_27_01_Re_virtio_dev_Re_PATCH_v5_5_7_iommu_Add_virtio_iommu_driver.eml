As far as I understand the figures above correspond to vhost-iommu
against vsmmuv3. In the 2 cases the guest owns stage1 tables so the
difference comes from the IOTLB invalidation handling. With vhost we
avoid a kernel <-> userspace round trip which may mostly explain the
difference.

About SMMUv3 issues I already reported one big limitation with respect
to hugepage invalidation. See [RFC v2 4/4] iommu/arm-smmu-v3: add
CMD_TLBI_NH_VA_AM command for iova range invalidation
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/8/11/428).

At smmuv3 guest driver level, arm_smmu_tlb_inv_range_nosync(), when
called with a hugepage size, invalidates each 4K/64K page of the region
and not the whole region at once. Each of them are trapped by the SMMUv3
device which forwards them to the host. This stalls the guest. This
issue can be observed in DPDK case - not the use case benchmarked above - .

I raised this point again in recent discussions and it is unclear
whether this is an SMMUv3 driver limitation or an architecture
limitation. Seems a single invalidation within the block mapping should
invalidate the whole mapping at HW level. In the past I hacked a
workaround by defining an implementation defined invalidation command.

Robin/Will, could you please explain the rationale behind the
arm_smmu_tlb_inv_range_nosync() implementation.

Thanks

Eric
