OK that clarifies it. I admit I was only testing these but didn't have 
time to look what changed exactly.

What I've said above about lame test being more FPU and mplayer more VMX 
intensive probably still holds as I've retried now on a Haswell i5 and got 
1-2% difference with lame_vmx and ~6% with mplayer. That's very little 
improvement but if only some VMX instructions should be faster then this 
may make sense.

These tests are not the best, maybe there are better ways to measure this 
but I don't know of any,

At least this seems to be a big bottleneck in PPC emulation and one that's 
not being worked on (others like hardfloat and VMX while not finished and 
still lot to do but already there are some results but no one is looking 
at softmmu). I was just trying to direct some attention to that softmmu 
may also need some optimisation and hope someone would notice this. I have 
some interest but not much time these days and if it scares you what 
should I say. I don't even understand most of it so it would take a lot of
time to even get how it works and what would need to be done. So I hope 
someone with more time or knowledge shows up and maybe at least provides 
some hints on what may need to be done.
