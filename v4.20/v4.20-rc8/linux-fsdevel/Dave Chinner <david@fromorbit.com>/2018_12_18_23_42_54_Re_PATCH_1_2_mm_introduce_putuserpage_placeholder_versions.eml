In general, no, because stable pages are controlled by block
devices.

void wait_for_stable_page(struct page *page)
{
        if (bdi_cap_stable_pages_required(inode_to_bdi(page->mapping->host)))
                wait_on_page_writeback(page);
}


I have previously advocated for the filesystem to be in control of
stable pages but, well, too many people shouted "but performance!"
and so we still have all these holes I wanted to close in our
code...

Correct, but that doesn't close the problem down because stable
pages are something we cannot rely on right now. We need to fix
wait_for_stable_page() to always block on page writeback before
this specific race condition goes away.

Sure, that's yet another aspect of the same problem - not getting a
write fault when the page is being written to. If we got a write
fault, then the wait_for_stable_page() call in ->page_mkwrite would
then solve the problem.

Essentially, what we are talking about is how to handle broken
hardware. I say we should just brun it with napalm and thermite
(i.e. taint the kernel with "unsupportable hardware") and force
wait_for_stable_page() to trigger when there are GUP mappings if
the underlying storage doesn't already require it.

Yes, and as we've discussed in previous threads and at LSFMM, that
needs to die and be replaced with file leases that allow the kernel
to revoke the GUP mappings by breaking the lease.

My goal is to create infrastructure that is sane, reliable,
verifiable and doesn't have gaping data integrity holes in it that
performs as well as the current nasty kernel bypass hacks we have
now. i.e. I don't care about the current mess as it's largely
unfixable - we're at the point where we need to fix the
architecture, not keep trying to slap band-aids over the worst of
the symptoms of the current mess.

None of the above are acceptable solutions - they all have nasty
corner cases which are going to be difficult to get right, test,
etc. IMO, the robust, reliable, testable solution is this:

5) The reflink breaks the file lease, the userspace app releases the
pinned pages on the file and drops the lease. The reflink proceeds,
does it's work, and then the app gets a new lease on the file. When
the app pins the pages again, it triggers new ->page_mkwrite calls
to break any sharing that the reflink created. And if the app fails
to drop the lease, then we can either fail with a lease related
error or kill it....

XFS already has all the file lease breaking stuff in it, we just
need userspace interfaces to expose them and userspace apps to start
using them.

Dave.
