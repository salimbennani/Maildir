Right. But that device is just an excersize, right?
It bothers me that next device might not remember and
we will get a mess.
Could we make it somehow that if there is no vmsd
then migration is blocked?

No, I am talking about a cross version/backend migration.

And it's such a boutique problem backends do not even
understand what it's about. A way to handle it
in the frontend is needed.

We also need a way to make sure incorrect backends do not
connect to incorrect devices, and we need a mechanism
that allows cross-version migration compatibility.

There's been a long discussion about cross-version
migration for vhost-user and I think Maxime had
a plan there. Maxime could you repost the
set of issues and what the plan is maybe?
