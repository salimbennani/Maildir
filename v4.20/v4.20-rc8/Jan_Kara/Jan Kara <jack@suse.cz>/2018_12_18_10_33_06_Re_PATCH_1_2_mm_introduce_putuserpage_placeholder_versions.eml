The scenario you describe here cannot happen exactly because of the
wait_for_stable_page() in ->page_mkwrite() you mention below. If someone
will try to GUP a page that is under writeback (has already PageWriteback
set), GUP will have to do a write fault because the page is writeprotected
in page tables and go into ->page_mkwrite() which will wait.

The problem rather is with someone mapping the page *before* writeback
starts, giving the page to HW. Then clear_page_dirty_for_io() writeprotects
the page in PTEs but the HW gives a damn about that. Then, after we add the
page to the bio but before the page gets bounced by the block layer, the HW
can still modify it.

So for anything in the block layer and below, doing the bouncing in the
block layer is enough. So DIF/DIX will work, device mapper targets will
work etc.  But you are right that if the filesystem itself needs stable
data, then bouncing in the block layer is not enough. Thanks for catching
this hole, I didn't think of that. Ext4 does not need stable data during
writeback, btrfs probably does as it needs to compute data checksums during
writeout. So we'll probably need something like clear_page_dirty_for_io()
returning a bounced page for data integrity writeback of a pinned page. And
the filesystem would then need to submit this page for IO.

Yes, the problem is that some RDMA hardware does not (and AFAIU cannot be
made to) follow the wait_for_stable_page() rules. And we have a userspace
visible API by which application can ask the kernel to give mapped file
pages to the HW as a buffer and the HW can fill in the contents at its will
until userspace tells the kernel to remove these mapped pages from the HW.
The interval how long userspace leaves these pages to the HW is upto
userspace and in practice it is often counted in hours.

If you want to tell me this is broken and could always corrupt data and
kill the kernel and what not, I agree. The goal is to avoid at least the
worst issues without breaking userspace too badly.

Interaction with COW is certainly an interesting problem. When the page
gets pinned, GUP will make sure the page is writeably mapped and trigger a
write fault if not. So at the moment the page is pinned, we are sure the
page is COWed. Now the question is what should happen when the file A
containing this pinned page gets reflinked to file B while the page is still
pinned.

Options I can see are:

1) Fail the reflink.
  - difficult for sysadmin to discover the source of failure

2) Block reflink until the pin of the page is released.
  - can last for a long time, again difficult to discover

3) Don't do anything special.
  - can corrupt data as read accesses through file B won't see
    modifications done to the page (and thus eventually the corresponding disk
    block) by the HW.

4) Immediately COW the block during reflink when the corresponding page
   cache page is pinned.
  - seems as the best solution at this point, although sadly also requires
    the most per-filesystem work
