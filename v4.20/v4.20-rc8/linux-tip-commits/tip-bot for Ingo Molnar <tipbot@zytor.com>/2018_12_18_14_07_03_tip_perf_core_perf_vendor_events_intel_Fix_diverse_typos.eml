perf vendor events intel: Fix diverse typos

Go over the tools/ files that are maintained in Arnaldo's tree and
fix common typos: half of them were in comments, the other half
in JSON files.

( Care should be taken not to re-import these typos in the future,
  if the JSON files get updated by the vendor without fixing the typos. )

No change in functionality intended.

Committer notes:

This was split from a larger patch as there are code that is,
additionally, maintained outside the kernel tree, so to ease cherry
picking and/or backporting, split this into multiple patches.

This is returned when a non-RFO request hits a cacheline in the Modified state. The Cache can either downgrade the cacheline to a S (Shared) or I (Invalid) state depending on how the system has been configured.  This response will also be sent when a cache requests E (Exclusive) ownership of a cache line without receiving data, because the cache must acquire ownership.",
