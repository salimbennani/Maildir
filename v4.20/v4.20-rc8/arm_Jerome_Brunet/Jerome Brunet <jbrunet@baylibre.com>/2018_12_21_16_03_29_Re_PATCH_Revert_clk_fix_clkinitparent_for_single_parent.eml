The problem is that CCF disallowed this from the beginning when rejecting NULL
in parent tables.

Are saying we should find and fix all the controllers with mux using value
table to avoid unknown/disconnected mux inputs ... sounds like a lot of work
for a benefit I still don't really understand.

Anywayu, adding support for this would be nice, I just don't understand how
the proposed patch how here makes it any harder.

AFAIK, the framework knows that index == 'num_parents' is an error.

If we are going to ignore something, I think that would be a minimum, yes.
I still don't like the fact that may we chose to ignore this.

Maybe but all controller so far have been done with this in mind, what about
those ?

I don't really get the difference in the framework ATM. Is this linked to the
'orphan probe defer logic' WIP you have been mentionning ?

All this below is very interresting but it looks like a very complex way to
solve what was initially a very simple problem, with considerations that are
still WIP a this stage.

Even with these future constraints in mind, I don't understand how the
proposed patch changes anything to the situtation. A clock with a get_parent()
callback (and several known parents) may still return an out of bound value
... CCF will still have to deal with this case gracefully, as it is currently
doing
