Mr. Caputo,

Please allow me to address some of the concerns you raised.=20

The Linux trademark is owned by Linus Torvalds and administered by the Linu=
x Foundation through the Linux Mark Institute: https://www.linuxmark.org. T=
he Linux trademark can be used by third parties subject to a Sublicense Agr=
eement: https://www.linuxmark.org/programs/legal/trademark/sublicense-agree=
ment. The terms of the Sublicense Agreement permit the use of the Linux tra=
demark for derivative goods and services that deploy, document, facilitate =
the use of, or enhance Linux=C2=AD-based goods.

WLinux does contain a bootable Linux kernel in a base image.  The criticism=
 that 'WSL is not Linux' is because the kernel is not executed when the bas=
e image is installed and run from within the WSL layer on Windows 10. But W=
Linux can be used to patch and build the Linux kernel from sources to insta=
ll on other devices, assist in deploying and configuring Linux on other dev=
ices, and can cross-compile software using standard Linux libraries, all wh=
en running on WSL. For more about how WSL works for those unfamiliar: https=
://github.com/sirredbeard/Awesome-WSL#overview. WLinux unquestionably conta=
ins derivations of the Linux kernel, relies on the WSL re-implementation of=
 Linux kernel syscalls, and facilitates the use of and enhances Linux-based=
 goods, all within the terms of the Linux Sublicense Agreement.

We obtained a valid Sublicense Agreement for the use of the Linux trademark=
 from the Linux Foundation before launching WLinux. All of our intellectual=
 property compliance disclosures are here: https://github.com/WhitewaterFou=
ndry/WLinux/blob/master/LICENSE.md

Users who purchase WLinux from the Microsoft Store are supporting the Linux=
 ecosystem and free software generally. Everyone working on WLinux are Wind=
ows and Linux users who are committed to making the Linux software ecosyste=
m accessible to as many people as possible regardless of what device or ope=
rating system they are on. WLinux and WSL generally opens up new possibilit=
ies for bringing people to the Linux ecosystem, cross-platform development,=
 and expanding access to free software and free software development tools.=
=20

WLinux builds in a number of value-added enhancements and features, we prov=
ide end user support, and work with various developer communities and other=
 open source companies to try to make it easy to get into the Linux ecosyst=
em from Windows 10.  We make it easy to get up and running with Go, Ruby, o=
ther dev toolchains, soon Docker, install various editors, configure predic=
tive text input for non-Latin input, and implement a handful of other tweak=
s to defaults. I personally do not believe a frontend dev stepping into Lin=
ux should have to know how to partition and dual-boot a system, or even hav=
e to learn Docker, to get started using node.js and trying different packag=
es off npm. They will get to that.

Many WLinux users are going to end up working on traditional server Linux e=
ventually, if they don't already, as many of our users seem to work in hybr=
id environments as it is. I imagine a few will end up trying and then switc=
hing to desktop Linux, again if they don't use it already. But desktop Linu=
x is just one small part of Linux, WLinux is not here to replace it, and WS=
L is not capable of doing so in it's current limitations. Users are not bei=
ng 'tricked'. Free upstream distros from Canonical, Debian, SuSE, and Kali =
are available where you can implement our tweaks and custom packages manual=
ly. Of the many copies we have sold we have only had two refund requests wh=
ich we have promptly honored. Users always have the option of building WLin=
ux from source using instructions we provide. WLinux is also heavily discou=
nted or free in many less developed countries.

We turn the funds WLinux earns around to hire open source developers, spons=
or bug and feature bounties, donate to upstream projects, and cover overhea=
d. We are profitable and expect to pay out over $2,000 USD in bounties this=
 month alone after being on the store for just six weeks. We are focused on=
 building a sustainable commercial open source project that can direct our =
own development resources where we see fit to improve the Linux experience =
on WSL for us, the users of Linux on WSL. Microsoft has had absolutely zero=
 input into how we have evolved WLinux besides open source code of theirs w=
e have used.
