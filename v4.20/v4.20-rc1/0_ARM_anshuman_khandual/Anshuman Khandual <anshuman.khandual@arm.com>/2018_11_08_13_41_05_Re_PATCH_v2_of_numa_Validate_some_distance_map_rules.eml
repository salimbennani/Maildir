Right.

Either it does enforce all these rules again or it does not. What is the
purpose it serves when enforcing parts of it ! Rather it should focus on
looking for boundary conditions (e.g maximum number of nodes supported
on a platform against whats present on the table) which are important
from kernel point of view.

Which exactly corresponds to first two rules as mentioned in the DT doc
(Documents/devicetree/bindings/numa.txt)

        1. Each entry represents distance from first node to second node.
        The distances are equal in either direction.
        2. The distance from a node to self (local distance) is represented
        with value 10 and all internode distance should be represented with
        a value greater than 10.

But if [a, b] and [b, a] both are present, they must be equal.

Falling back to REMOTE_DISTANCE is right in case one of the symmetrical
distances is not present. But it must abort if they are present and not
identical. That rule should be enforced here while processing DT.

We could override but if the DT passed table is inconsistent then it must
abort as non-symmetrical distance is not supported. Hence overriding the
distance should happen only in case the inverse set is absent (probably
outside the first loop).

Right.

This is where we still have some inconsistencies. Arch NUMA code on arm64
should either enforce rule 1 and 2 as stated above or should not at all. As
discussed previously numa_set_distance() enforces first part of rule 2
(self distance should be 10) but not the second part of rule 2 (internode
distance > 10). So either the following condition should be dropped from

(from == to && distance != LOCAL_DISTANCE)

or the following condition should be added to

(from != to && distance <= LOCAL_DISTANCE)

numa_set_distance() in order to conform to the semantics described above.
But thats for a separate discussion how much and what should be enforced
in any given DT compatible arch NUMA node. May not be part of this patch.

It makes sense to go through the table and print the finalized values
(being passed to arch NUMA) out side of this loop after any identical
replacement is done.

As mentioned before it should invalidate the table [a, b] != [b, a] in
case they are present and not equal.
