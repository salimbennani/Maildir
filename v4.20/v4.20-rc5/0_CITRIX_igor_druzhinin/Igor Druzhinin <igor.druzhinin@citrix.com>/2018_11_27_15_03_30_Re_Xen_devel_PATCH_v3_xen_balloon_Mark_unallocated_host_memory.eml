After their last commit I don't see how this can be broken:
1) They only claim addresses starting from 0xbd00000000
*unconditionally* which means if there is some memory behind this range
on the host (regardless if it's Dom0 or native Linux) they'll break
their own systems.

2) So, theoretically, to trigger the original issue we'd need to have a
system with RAM higher than 0xbd00000000 and that shouldn't be assigned
to Dom0 but that contradicts (1).
