Thank you for the description of your approach.

Predefined DT color definitions make an interesting option. Nonetheless,
your design assumes that for RGB LEDs max_brightness would have to be
always 1.

While it would solve the issue, it wouldn't allow to benefit from
the whole potential of RGB LEDs - think of having adjustable "color
brightness" (like in HSV color model).

How abut allowing for providing an array of color intensity/brightness
levels per each color? In the simplest case there could be a single
level per color, but it should be possible to provide up to 255 levels.
