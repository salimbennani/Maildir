This is getting way off-topic, but:

The C standard does not care deeply about practical source code
compatibility.  Behavior of valid syntax generally remains unchanged.
However, each revision adds many macros to existing header files, so
practical source code compatibility tends to be problematic.  For glibc,
the current policy is to enable all optional features with _GNU_SOURCE,
so most projects receive the full dose of macros.  (Unrelated to
standards, even new system call wrappers are problematic for source code
compatibility).)

For ABI compatibility, there are only ad-hoc standards anyway, so it's
mostly about us being careful when making changes.

In the past, we couldn't even get agreement about little things such as
__u64, so I'm not hopeful. 8-(
