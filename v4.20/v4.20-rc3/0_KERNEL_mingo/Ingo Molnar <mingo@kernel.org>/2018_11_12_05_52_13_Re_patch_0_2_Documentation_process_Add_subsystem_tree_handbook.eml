Yeah, I didn't intend this paragraph to be a local quirk - more like a 
reiteration of what the global rule already is (regardless of enforcement 
...), given the context.

I presume the cross section of readers of *both* the global documents and 
the -tip documents will be even smaller than just the readers of the -tip 
document - so some redundancy is beneficial. ;-)

In that sense the 'local' rules can also be indicators about which parts 
of the myriads of global rules the maintainers feel most strongly about, 
and are also a list of the most common problems we see in practice. Just 
repeating the very large set of global rules is counter-productive in 
that fashion. Maybe we should re-phrase and re-structure it into such a 
format, with references back to the original rules where we are just 
reiterating global rules? That would also allow the eventual inclusion of 
any clarification into the global rule.

Another aspect is that in -tip we are pretty strict about certain 
stylistic and not so stylistic details - this is partly a personal 
preference of the maintainers, and partly a maintainer workload reduction 
measure.

But level of enforcement matters and I think other trees can legitimately 
be more relaxed: when there's a lack of contributors then you *really* 
don't want to be the maintainer-from-hell who wants all i's dotted and 
all t's crossed, and you might not have the bandwidth to do it all 
yourself ...

Also I think there are and should be a lot of shades of grey when it 
comes to accepting patches, to find the right balance between pushing 
back on patches to improve quality and pulling in patches to move the 
kernel forward.

Yeah, so in -tip we don't do "local customs": we genuinely believe that 
*all* our rules where they go beyond the current development process 
would improve the generic kernel as well. (In fact if anyone can give 
reasons for why a particular rule is not an absolute advantage to the 
kernel we'd reconsider changing the rule.)

So your complaint is legitimate - how would you propose we handle this?

Thanks,

	Ingo
