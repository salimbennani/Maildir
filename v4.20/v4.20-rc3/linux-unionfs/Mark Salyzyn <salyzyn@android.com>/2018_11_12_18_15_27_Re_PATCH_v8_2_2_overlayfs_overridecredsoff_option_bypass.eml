Alas, I personally object to changes to the kernel that have a limited 
(well, 1.8billion devices is not limited) use case. If they can benefit 
others, they become more useful. This paradigm helps prevent spaghetti 
and areas of the kernel that are not well understood and subject to bitrot.

adb starts far too late to be useful for the original mount operation. 
We have to mount at init first stage before sepolicy is loaded and init 
is re-exec'd. adb root / adb remount / adb push is relegated to updating 
the content before a reboot to activate _some_ of the possible things 
that developers adjust.

Yes, I find the ability to relinquish the overlayfs and restore the 
system to original an added-value, whereas if we could adjust the 
system&root filesystems directly, a complete reflash is required to 
restore back. We only activate/use the overlayfs for read-only 
system&root filesystems.

Yup, no upper layers. If this was the only uses case, but it isn't.

Besides, I submitted this patch _before_ this second use case presented 
itself as required, it was a later development during the lifetime of 
this patch, so admittedly still focused on the first use case.

I should regroup in the documentation and present the use cases 
individually and specifically ... as you suggest :-) Off to consider a 
v9 respin (KISS documentation has always been troublesome for me) ...

[TL;DR]

The remain snapshot discussion is a distraction, I will have to defer to 
Paul to answer to them (and yes, we have discussed eye-to-eye over this 
and private emails). I agree with the details you have added to the 
conversation.

Sadly the CL in question needs to solve the caveats before we could 
consider overlayfs for userdata.

Thanks for these comments! We should consider when the dust settles.

Sincerely -- Mark Salyzyn
