My previous commit used the compatible string to set the HCD flag
instead of a device tree property, but Alan Stern ask me to use a DT
binding instead. This has the advantage of having the code in one
place in the phy.c module instead of having to add it to the OHCI,
EHCI and XHCI platform drivers.

The Generic PHY subsystem allows the PHY provider to export
phy_power_on/phy_power_off and phy_init/phy_exit functions for use by
the PHY consumer. The exact functionality of these routines seems to
vary among the different PHY provider drivers. The Broadcom USB PHY
driver expects the phy_power_on/phy_power_off to be used on
suspend/resume and the phy_init/phy_exit to be used by the consumer
driver's probe/remove routines. The new USB PHY consumer code does not
do this, instead it calls both power_off AND exit for both suspend
(not wakable) and remove. If you look at other PHY provider/consumer
implementations in the kernel tree you'll find examples of both these
methods but there are more examples that behave like the Broadcom PHY.
What I was trying to do was to use a DT property to tell the USB PHY
consumer code which method to use.

I guess the problem is that the current generic PHY api only allows
the consumer to put the PHY in 1 of 3 states, EXIT, OFF or ON. The
current USB PHY consumer code is using OFF for "suspend with wakeup"
and EXIT for "suspend without wakeup". The Broadcom PHY driver wants
OFF for either "suspend with wakeup" or "suspend without wakeup" and
EXIT when there are no consumers using the PHY. If the PHY API allowed
for 4 states, EXIT, OFF_NOT_WAKABLE, OFF_WAKABLE and ON then the
individual PHY provider could hide the differences, but this seems
hard to retrofit into the PHY subsystem.
