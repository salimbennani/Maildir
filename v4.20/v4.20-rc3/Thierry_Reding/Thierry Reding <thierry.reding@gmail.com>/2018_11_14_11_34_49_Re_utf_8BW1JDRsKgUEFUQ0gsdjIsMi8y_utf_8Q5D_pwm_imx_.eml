No, that's not at all correct. Pinmux settings should reside with the
consumer of the pin. In this case, the PWM is the consumer of the pin,
whereas the backlight is the consumer of the *PWM*.

The problem with making the PWM mode the "default" pinctrl state is that
the default state will be applied before the driver is even probed. That
makes it unsuitable for this case. I think what we really want here is
explicitly "active" and "inactive" states for pinctrl where the PWM
driver controls when exactly each state is applied.

This solves the problem quite nicely because by default the pinctrl
state isn't touched. For the case where the bootloader didn't initialize
the PWM pin at all, the driver core won't do anything and keep it at the
100k pull-up default. Only when the PWM is actually taken into active
use will the "active" state (i.e. PWM mode) be applied, so that the PWM
can drive it with the right configuration to give the desired result. If
the bootloader did initialize the PWM it would also work because then at
PWM driver probe time we don't do anything either, keeping the pin in
the PWM mode as configured by the bootloader and not touching the PWM
configuration either. If hardware readout is implemented, we can load
the exact state that we're in and seamlessly take over in the kernel
driver. Enabling the PWM in this case would apply the current setting,
which should be a no-op, or at least idempotent.

With the pinctrl-based solution outlined above you can even operate a
sysfs consumer properly. The pinctrl states are where they belong, with
the PWM device and therefore they can be properly set when the PWM is
used, rather than waiting for a PWM consumer to muck with the pinmux.

Note how all the pieces are suddenly falling into place. In my
experience that's usually a good indication that you're on the right
track.
