The PCIe Base Spec is pretty big, so I wish this reference were a
little more explicit.  I *guess* maybe it's referring to PCIe r4.0,
figure 6-3 in sec 6.2.6, where PCIe ERR_* Messages can be routed to
"INTx or MSI Error Interrupts" and/or "platform-specific System Error"
interrupts.

"Device interrupts" seems like it refers to the "INTx or MSI"
interrupts, not the platform-specific System Errors, so I would read
that as saying "if firmware grants OS control of AER via _OSC,
firmware must set the AER Reporting Enables in the AER Root Error
Command register."  But that seems a little silly because the OS now
*owns* the AER capability and it can set the AER Root Error Command
register itself if it wants to.

And I still don't see the connection here with Firmware-First.  I'm
pretty sure firmware could not be notified via INTx or MSI interrupts
because those are totally managed by OSPM.

It seems like these HEST structures are "here's how firmware thinks
you should set up AER on this device".  But I agree, I have no idea
how to interpret "Enabled".  The rest of the HEST fields cover all the
useful AER registers, including the Reporting Enables in the AER Root
Error Command register *and* the Error Reporting Enables in the Device
Control register.  So I don't know what the "Enabled" field adds to
all that.  What a mess.

It makes good sense that if OSPM doesn't have AER control, firmware
does all AER handling, including any setup for firmware-first
notification.  If we can assume that firmware-first notification is
done in some way the OS doesn't know about and can't mess up, that
would be awesome.

But I think the VMD model really has nothing to do with the APEI
firmware-first model.  With VMD, it sounds like OSPM owns the AER
capability and doesn't know firmware exists *except* that it has to be
careful not to step on firmware's interrupt.  So maybe we can handle it
separately.
