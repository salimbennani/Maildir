This may create some confusion if only "Pull requests accepted" is the
contents of this section.  My understanding has been that all changes
should be available on a mail list for review before being accepted
by the maintainer, even if eventually the final version of the series
that is accepted is applied by the maintainer as a pull instead of
via applying patches.

Is my "must appear on a mail list" understanding correct?

I would expect the -rc to vary based on the patch series size, complexity,
risk, number of revisions that will occur, how controversial, number of
-rc releases before Linus chooses to release, etc.  You would need a
crystal ball to predict much of this.  I could see being able to provide
a good estimate of this value for a relatively simple patch.

Same comment as for the previous section, with the additional complexity
that each unique patch series should bake in -next.

The title of this section seems a bit different than the description
below.  A more aligned title would be something like "Maintainer
self-commit review requirements".

Then another section (which is the one I expected when I slightly
mis-read the section title) would be: Review Tags Requirements",
which would discuss what type of review is expected, encouraged,
or required.

Or ping instead of resubmitting?  If you resubmit the same series with
an unchanged version then comments could be split across multiple
email threads.  If you resubmit the same series with a new version
number, the same comment split can occur plus it can be confusing
that two versions have the same contents.  I suspect that there may be
some maintainers who do prefer a resubmit, but that is just wild
conjecture on my part.

This seems redundant with the MAINTAINERS reviewers list.  It seems like
the role specified in this section is more of an ombudsman or developer
advocate who can assist with the review and/or accept flow if the
maintainer is being slow to respond.

I would strike "actively monitoring the mailing list".  To me, it should
be what are the hours of the day that the maintainer might happen to poll
(or might receive an interrupt) from the appropriate communications
channels (could be IRC, could be email, etc).

For my area, I would want to say something like: I tend to be active
between 17:00 UTC (18:00 UTC when daylight savings) and 25:00 (26:00),
but often will check for urgent or brief items up until 07:00 (08:00).
I interact with email via a poll model.  I interact with IRC via a
pull model and often overlook IRC activity for multiple days).
