Actually it isn't so much that hotplug is special. The issue is more 
that the non-hotplug case is special in that you have to perform a 
number of extra checks for things that just aren't necessary for the 
hotplug case.

If anything I would probably need a new iterator that would be able to 
take into account all the checks for the non-hotplug case and then 
provide ranges of PFNs to initialize.

Yeah, the iterators were mostly an attempt at hiding some of the 
complexity. Being able to break a loop down to just an iterator provding 
the start of the range and the number of elements to initialize is 
pretty easy to visualize, or at least I thought so.

I plan to remove it, but don't think I can get to it in this patch set.

I was planning to submit one more iteration of this patch set early next 
week, and then start focusing more on the removal of the PageReserved 
bit for hotplug. I figure it is probably going to be a full patch set 
onto itself and as you pointed out at the start of this email there is 
already enough code to review without adding that.
