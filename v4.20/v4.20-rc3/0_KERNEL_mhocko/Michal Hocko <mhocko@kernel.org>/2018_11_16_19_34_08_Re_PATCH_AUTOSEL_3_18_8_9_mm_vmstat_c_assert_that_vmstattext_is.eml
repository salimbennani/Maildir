No. There is no known bug. I am arguing that such a change needs some
time to settle. I am quite skeptical that this will actually trigger
any bug.

I will not _object_ if this was merged if somebody explicitly asks for
it. I am saying that I am not convinced it is a stable material.

So I guess our views on what is stable material differ. As I have said
several times already, I think the volume of patches flowing to the
stable tree is really high. To the point that taking stable trees for
our SLES kernels become problematic. I have heard the similar from
others. More is not always better. But let's not repeat this discussion
again. If Andrew doesn't mind then keep sending AUTOSEL emails but
please let's not apply those patches automatically.

Thanks!
