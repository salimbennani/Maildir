it is useful to debug the fault ;-)

Although eventually we'll want to be able to do more than that, like
have the fault trigger bringing in pages of a mmap'd file and that
sort of thing.

Sure, it is a bug.. but it can be an application bug that is not
something the userspace GL driver or kernel could do anything about.
We shouldn't let this kill the GPU.  If the application didn't have
this much control, we wouldn't need an IOMMU in the first place[1].
With opencl compute, the userspace controlled shader has full blown
pointers to GPU memory.

And even in cases where it is a userspace GL driver bug, having some
robustness to not completely kill the GPU makes debugging much easier.
Something I do a lot when bringing up support for a new generation of
GPU.

I'm having a hard time understanding your objection to this.
Returning zero's for non-faulting transactions is a *really bad idea*.

BR,
-R


[1] yes, vc4 did without an IOMMU.. but it also had to do some fairly
complex shader analysis in the kernel, and it was restricted to gles2
feature set, so no real flow control, and no memory access beyond
texture fetch.
