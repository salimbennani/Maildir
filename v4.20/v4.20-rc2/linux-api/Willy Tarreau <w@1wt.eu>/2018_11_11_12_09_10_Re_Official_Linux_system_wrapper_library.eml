Good point on this one. I could even have thought that most syscalls
are added with glibc in mind but your counter-example above could
remain valid.

But don't you think that moving a bit of this into the kernel
repository could improve the situation ? The corner cases could then
be detected when the feature is developed and be addressed either by
adapting the kernel side of the syscall or even by changing the design
before it's committed. Maybe a few extra syscalls are missing to
retrieve some critial info that would make things more reliable or
easier between userland and kernel, and that would become more obvious
with all the relevant parts at the same place ?

For having suffered a lot from the libc-4 to libc-5 then libc-5 to glibc,
I certainly can understand their concerns about standards compliance.

Probably that these standard compatibility issues should be addressed at
their root in the kernel header definitions in fact. Working around issues
always leads to a stall at some point, and it encourages the process not
to change.

This one could possibly be got rid of. When I build glibc, I specify the
oldest supported kernel, which usually is older than or equal to the
headers used to build, but I don't expect that newer features will
magically work at all. Thus I normally build with the most recent
headers covering my needs.

Thanks,
Willy
