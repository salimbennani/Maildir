I don't quite follow. As far as I understand, the extended timeout is
needed when turning the cache on.

The above seems more related to flushing the cache, no? Flushing have
no timeout (also reported to be an issue [1]), which happens either at
_mmc_hw_reset() or at _mmc_suspend().

What is the relation here?

Using no limit of the timeout, would mean we may hang for ~10 minutes
(MMC_OPS_TIMEOUT_MS) instead, no thanks.

I am fine with let's say double of 850ms (1700ms), to have some room.

Anyway, the point is, the timeouts in the spec is there for reason.
Unfortunate I think the spec is "lazy" in some other regards and don't
specify timeouts, which complicates things.

Kind regards
