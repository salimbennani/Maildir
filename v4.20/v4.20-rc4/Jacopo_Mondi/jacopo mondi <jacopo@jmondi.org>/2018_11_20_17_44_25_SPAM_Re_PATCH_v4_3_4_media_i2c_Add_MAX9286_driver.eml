Yes, that's true for systems with a single max9286 [1]

We have a system with 2 de-serializers, and what happens is the
following:

The system starts with the following configuration:

1)
                    +------- max9271@40
                    +------- max9271@40
Soc ----> max9286 --+------- max9271@40
                    +------- max9271@40

with a single max9286 it would be easy. We operate on one channel at
the time, do the reprogramming (or set up the translation, for the TI
chip use case) when adding the adapter for the channel, and then we
can talk with all remotes, which now have a different address

2)
                    +-------- max9271@50
                    +--- / -- max9271@40
Soc ----> max9286 --+--- / -- max9271@40
                    +--- / -- max9271@40


                    +--- / -- max9271@50
                    +-------- max9271@51
Soc ----> max9286 --+--- / -- max9271@40
                    +--- / -- max9271@40

                    +--- / -- max9271@50
                    +--- / -- max9271@51
Soc ----> max9286 --+-------- max9271@52
                    +--- / -- max9271@40

                    +--- / -- max9271@50
                    +--- / -- max9271@51
Soc ----> max9286 --+--- / -- max9271@52
                    +-------- max9271@53

Of course, to do the reprogramming, we need to initially send messages
to the default 0x40 address each max9271 boots with. If we don't close
all channels but the one we intend to reprogram, all remotes would
receive the same message, and thus will be re-programmed to the same
address (not nice). [2]

Now, if you have two max9286, installed on the same i2c bus, then you
need to make sure all channels of the 'others' are closed, before you
can reprogram your remotes, otherwise, you would end up reprogramming
all the remotes of the 'others' when trying to reprogram yours, as our
local de-serializers, bounces everything they receives, not directed
to them, to their remote sides.

3)

....

With the (not nice) 'max9286_is_bound()' we make sure we close all
channels on all max9286 first

And then only the last one to probe calls the re-programming
phase for all its fellows de-serializers on the bus.

When addr reprogramming is done, we enter the image streaming phase,
with all channels open, as now, all remotes, have a different i2c
address assigned.

Suggestions on how to better handle this are very welcome. The point
here is that, to me, this is a gmsl-specific implementation thing.

Do you think for your chips, if they do translations, can you easy mask
them with the i2c address you want (being that specified in the remote
node or selected from an i2c-addr-pool, or something else) without
having to care about others remotes to be accidentally programmed to
an i2c address they're not intended to be assigned to.

Hope this helps clarify your concerns, and I think the actual issue
to discuss, at least on bindings, would be the i2c-address assignment
method, as this impacts GMSL, as well as other implementation that
would use the same binding style as this patches.

Thanks

[1] I still don't get why 'addr translation' >> 'addr reprogramming'.
Even the GMSL application development examples uses addr reprogramming,
so I guess this is how those chips are supposed to work.

[2] If your local side supports address translation, you don't need to
talk with the remote side to 'mask' it, so you don't need this workaround.
