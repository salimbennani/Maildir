Whilst making an unrelated change to some Documentation, Linus sayeth:

  | Afaik, even in Britain, "whilst" is unusual and considered more
  | formal, and "while" is the common word.
  |
  | [...]
  |
  | Can we just admit that we work with computers, and we don't need to
  | use Ã¾e eald Englisc spelling of words that most of the world never
  | uses?

dictionary.com refers to the word as "Chiefly British", which is
probably an undesirable attribute for technical documentation.

Replace all occurrences under Documentation/ with "while".
