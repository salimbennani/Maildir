I don't plan to implement anything like that. Here's what I'm planning:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/robh/linux.git/log/?h=dt/testing

Which is eliminating the need to access .name by: using %pOFn (mostly
in 4.20), using of_node_name_eq() wrapper, or using full_name instead.
The last case generally is cases where the name is not important such
as request_irq() or irq_chip.name.

So either it needs to be the only interface to drivers or the fwnode
and DT APIs need to have the same calls. We don't want drivers to use
different style/design of API based on picking fwnode or DT API. If
you have the same calls, there's no point to trying to copy the common
parts into fwnode code. Then you have 3 implementations of the same
thing instead of 2.

That's not what I'm suggesting. I'm saying that is a firmware level
detail that should remain in firmware code.

I'm actually hoping to move things over to be case sensitive in most
cases. That may mean having some work-around like:

if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PPC_PMAC))
  ... strcasecmp()
else
  ... strcmp()

Or whatever system needs this. I think it is old PowerMacs, but am not
really sure. And yeah, that would be ugly, but at least we'd know what
exactly needs it. Do you want this crap is fwnode code?
