The intention was that the "sifive,pwm0" compatible string specifies a
register interface and programming model that the IP block exposes to
the software, rather than a particular underlying hardware
implementation.  That is in contrast to a string like
"sifive,fu540-c000-pwm" which might activate particular workarounds or
quirks that are specific to the integration of the IP block on a given SoC.


The idea is that, for this and similar open-source hardware IP blocks,
the driver code can just match on a generic "sifive,pwm0" compatible
string.  The SoC DT data would include both the SoC-specific
"sifive,fu540-c000-pwm0" and the common interface "sifive,pwm0".  But
the driver would only need the SoC-specific compatible string if the SoC
wound up needing some SoC-specific quirks.


In the past, some folks have had a problem with that idea, since for
closed-source IP blocks, it's been difficult to determine what changes
went into a specific version of the IP block.  Thus folks generating
data for later SoCs usually specify a compatible string for another,
older, SoC that seems to have the desired behavior.  But since this
particular IP block has open-source RTL, and contains a "sifive,pwmX"
version string in the RTL itself:


https://github.com/sifive/sifive-blocks/blob/master/src/main/scala/devices/pwm/PWM.scala#L74


... it's straightforward to see what interface the hardware exposes to
the software for a given compatible string.


> Is there a need to have two compatible strings
> that refer to the exact same hardware?


There's no intention that "sifive,pwm0" and "sifive,fu540-c000-pwm0"
refer to the same hardware; just the same software interface and
programming model.  Even now, it's usually pretty unlikely that two
different SoCs that refer to (say) "nvidia,tegra20-pwm" contain the same
hardware, since differences in synthesis, place and route, ECOs, and
integration change the actual realization of the hardware.  Some folks
interpreted that compatible string reuse as implying the same "hardware"
is in use on both SoCs, but we're really just identifying a software
interface.
