Is there any specific benchmark test you were wanting me to run? As far 
as crude numbers this patch set started out specifically focused on 
patch 9/9, but I thought it best to apply it more generically as I found 
we could still run into the issue if we enabled async_probe.

What I have seen on several systems is a pretty significant improvement 
in initialization time for persistent memory. In the case of 3TB of 
memory being initialized on a single node the improvement in the worst 
case was from about 36s down to 26s for total initialization time.

I plan to resubmit this set after plumber's since there were a few typos 
and bits of comment left over in a patch description that needed to be 
sorted out. I will try to make certain to have any benchmark data I have 
included with the set the next time I put it out.

Thanks.
