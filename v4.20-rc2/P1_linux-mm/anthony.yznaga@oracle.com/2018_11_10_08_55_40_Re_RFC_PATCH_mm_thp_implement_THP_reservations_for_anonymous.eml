Good questions.  I'll take them into account when measuring performance.
I do wonder about other architectures (e.g. ARM) where the PMD
size may be significantly larger than 2MB.

These are compelling arguments.  I will be sure to evaluate any
performance data against this alternate implementation/tuning.

Thank you for the comments.
