Currently unsure how/where to force bypass of the cache (performance hit) as it is wired in throughout the code without a clear off switch, or rechecking of the credentials at access.

Will respin with adjustment to documentation and head towards v9.

I would prefer to have a complete solution to the non-overlapping 
security model,
and maybe in time it will come, but admittedly only if motivated to use 
overlayfs on
Android's userdata (see below) where all these issues would need to be 
solved.

Consider this (far simpler) patch a shot across the bow that an 
overlayfs use case was
removed in 4.6, and for completeness at least we would like to see it 
back. Would the ideal
be that the creator's credentials are only used to facilitate some 
workdir or r/w upperdir
operations, and user credentials are rechecked in more places in cache. From
my perspective feels like whack a mole for a few iterations. In that 
case, this option is
the start of those iterations "if you build it they will come"?

The first one would be an investigation on how to solve Vivek's scenario 
in the face of this change? (not volunteering today to do that, 
admitting to a shortcoming, and a need for a deeper understanding of the 
code for the moment)

I am not a "great communicator"(tm), probably only 50K vocabulary,
propensity towards quantum leaps, so yes, I was worried about confusion.
non-overlapping security model is the key takeaway I feel.

[TL;DR]

In Android there are two use cases this covers:

1) On userdebug (rooted development) builds, adb remount feature
    for readonly filesystems which include squashfs, ext4 dedupe,
    and any right-sized (zero space left over) filesystems.  In these cases
    the system will resort to utilizing overlayfs, and allow for
    updated content to a scratch backing storage.
2) On operating system updates where new Hardware Abstraction
    layers have been added and the vendor/oem supplied components
    supplied to an older release.  In this corner case the operating
    system update may carefully select overrides that are merged into
    the vendor partition content directories as hosted by the
    operating system partition.

The sepolicy model can be browsed at 
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/sepolicy/.

In the first use case above the possible insecurity is tempered by the 
debug nature
of the system and the lurking big elephant in the room privilege 
escalation possibility
(/system/bin/su existing), in the other a r/o and precise MAC. sepolicy 
and credentials
will rule over transitions from one security domain to another for 
execution, vendor components are managed by a separate vendor_init and 
the actual xattr content is constant.

Being able to block reading a file or directory is not a big concern in 
the associated trees, because all of the originals are backed by a r/o 
filesystem image, the content
is generally visible by all, and if not they are locally restricted 
views into a public filesystem image, that themselves can be mounted on 
a desktop. There are no privilege escalation or privacy issues.

An Android use case this does not cover securely is when overlayfs is 
used as a
snapshot of the users data during the update process to permit easy 
rollback of user data due to an
update failure (very unlikely 0.01%, but alas there are tachyons with 
our names on them).
For those use cases we have opted to add snapshot-ting to
f2fs and ext4 (using dm-bow in another patch set under discussion for 
the time being)
and abandoned overlayfs as insufficient in a dynamic non-overlapping DAC 
and MAC security model.
Built in filesystem snapshot-ting is always preferred for performance,
efficiency and access to the free block pools they maintain so that was an
easy choice.
