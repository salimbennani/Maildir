In our case it is very simple. There is "color" named sysfs node under 
gpio instance.

It creates own led instance for each children in this case it is named 
as "status" and then uses properties under it to define operation.

Currently we do have fixed list of color names in driver to require 
"standardized" names but that could be easily changed to be dynamic.

Driver registers all GPIOs defined in "gpios" under the instance.

So one can say:

echo "orange" > color

This setting goes to the driver, it figures out logical name "orange" 
and the configure all listed GPIO's to its "pin-mask" state. Polarity of 
the GPIO's is configured in GPIO definition so this is more or less turn 
this particular pin to activate state.

So in this case it changes led's color to orange and still lets one to 
use standard led triggers. Eg. set periodic blinking or so.

If one cat's "color" it lists all available colors for user and shows 
which one is active.

When brightness is configured as zero the all registered go to off state 
and when non-zero then it goes to state what ever is configured with 
"color" sysfs entry.

We do not usually use PWM controlled leds so our calibration has been HW 
engineer tuning the resistors for the leds to get acceptable color for 
different colors variations.

If one wants to have fixed colors for such device then one could use 
this similar method to define them or/and free form interface to enter 
RGB values there. Thou with PWM RGB leds you probably want to have more 
animation there which probably would require some additional support code.

One way to do atomic PWM RGB color change with sysfs could be:

echo "21 223 242" > color

or

echo "21 223 242" > rgb

or:

echo "r:21 g:232 b:242" > color (or something similar)

and if there is know registered name then just write it to "color" which 
would pick registered color rgb values to led instances rgb value.

Now for PWM RGB led one could use "brightness" and "rgb" value to 
calculate actual color with some color space formula (like hsv in [0]).

Doing white with RGB LED is a bit hard so usually you want to get RGBW 
LED (or RGBAW LED) if "real" white is something that is needed. This 
could then be "rgbw" entry and "color" to pick from fixed set.

These presets in device tree for "color" could be considered one way of 
doing calibration for particular hardware.

So in device tree for RGB PWM led it could be like:

color-orange {
     rgb = <249 197 9>
}

color-warm-white {
     rgb = <255 253 249>
}

How would that sound like?
