I'm also skeptical about this: the current design is quite
intentional. It's not a bug but a feature that we're not doing the
promotion.

Part of the tradeoff with THP is to use more RAM to save CPU, when you
use less RAM you're inherently already wasting some CPU just for the
reservation management and you don't get the immediate TLB benefit
anymore either.

And if you're in the camp that is concerned about the use of more RAM
or/and about the higher latency of COW faults, I'm afraid the
intermediate solution will be still slower than the already available
MADV_NOHUGEPAGE or enabled=madvise.

Apps like redis that will use more RAM during snapshot and that are
slowed down with THP needs to simply use MADV_NOHUGEPAGE which already
exists as an madvise from the very first kernel that supported
THP-anon. Same thing for other apps that use more RAM with THP and
that are on the losing end of the tradeoff.

Now about the implementation: the whole point of the reservation
complexity is to skip the khugepaged copy, so it can collapse in
place. Is skipping the copy worth it? Isn't the big cost the IPI
anyway to avoid leaving two simultaneous TLB mappings of different
granularity?

khugepaged is already tunable to specify a ratio of memory in use to
avoid wasting memory
/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/max_ptes_none.

If you set max_ptes_none to half the default value, it'll only promote
pages that are half mapped, reducing the memory waste to 50% of what
it is by default.

So if you are ok to copy the memory that you promote to THP, you'd
just need a global THP mode to avoid allocating THP even when they're
available during the page fault (while still allowing khugepaged to
collapse hugepages in the background), and then reduce max_ptes_none
to get the desired promotion ratio.

Doing the copy will avoid the reservation there will be also more THP
available to use for those khugepaged users without losing them in
reservations. You won't have to worry about what to do when there's
memory pressure because you won't have to undo the reservation because
there was no reservation in the first place. That problem also goes
away with the copy.

So it sounds like you could achieve a similar runtime behavior with
much less complexity by reducing max_ptes_none and by doing the copy
and dropping all reservation code.

Same here.

Thanks,
Andrea
