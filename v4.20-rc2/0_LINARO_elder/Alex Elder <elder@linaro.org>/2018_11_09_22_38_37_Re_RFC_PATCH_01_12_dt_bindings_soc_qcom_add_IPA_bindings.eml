I'll use "qcom,sdm845-ipa-modem-init" and "qcom,sdm845-ipa-tz-init".
(Or just "qcom,sdm845-ipa", depending on the outcome of the discussion
below.)

OK.

There is some early initialization, including loading some firmware,
that must be done by trusted code.  That can be done by either Trust
Zone or the modem.  If it's done by the modem, there is an additional
step required during initialization so the modem can tell the AP
that it has done its part, and the AP can finish IPA initialization.

There  is no way of detecting (e.g. by probing hardware) which is
in effect so we use DT.  I discussed this with Bjorn, who said that
this was a situation seen elsewhere and that using compatible strings
was the way he suggested to address it.

A Boolean property to distinguish them would be fine as well, but
I would like to address this "common" problem consistently.

Bjorn, would you please weigh in?

I used interrupts-extended because there were two interrupt parents
(a "normal" interrupt controller and the interrupt controller implemented
for SMP2P input).  A paragraph here:
    bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
recommends "interrupts-extended" in that case.

I have no objection to using just "interrupts" but can you tell me what
I misunderstood?  It seems like I need to do "interrupts-extended".

Done.  And I did this throughout the file where there was more than
one name.  One per line, no comma, no "and".

Yeah I have been thinking this but hadn't followed through on
doing anything about it yet.  I'll remove this node entirely.
It's possible it had other properties at one time, but in the
end this  represents a soft interface and can be implemented
within the IPA driver.

Thanks a lot for the review.
