There is a limit to max number of threads that ktasks start. The memory
throughput is *much* higher than what one CPU can maxout in a node, so
there is no reason to leave the other CPUs sit idle during boot when
they can help to initialize.

Yes, but in both cases we are far from maxing out the memory throughput.
The 3.88x is indeed low, and I do not know what slows it down.

Daniel,

Could you please check why multi-threading efficiency is so low here?

I bet, there is some atomic operation introduces a contention within a
node. It should be possible to resolve.

Ah, I thought in your experiment persistent memory takes deferred init
path. So, what exactly in your patches make this 1.26x speedup?

I do not disagree, I think these two patch series should complement each
other. But, if your changes make it impossible for ktask, I would strongly argue
against it, as the potential improvements with ktasks are much higher.
But, so far I do not see anything, so I think they can work together. I
am still reviewing your work.

Which is totally OK, it should make ktasks scale even better.
