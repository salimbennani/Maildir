I hope my comment below will serve as an example why explaining your use
case is preferred to presenting the abstract and generalized problem.
And still - no objections to your current patch, *because* it can solve your
use cases and *because* we don't need to deal with the  abstract and
generalized problem.

Since you already have an elephant in the room, might as well use it
to mount overlay. I am guessing most of the work in developer mode is
with sepolicy disabled anyway?
Essentially, adb root/adb remount means gloves are off.
Although with overlayed adb remount gloves could be put back on
when you relinquish the overlay and get back to original /system mount.

For this use case, you don't need an upper layer at all and you probably
don't use lower layers redirect_dir. Right?
So all the concerns about get/set trusted overlay xattrs and detecting
opaque directories (do you need those?) are moot.
If you propose that override_creds=off can only be enabled
on lower-only overlayfs, the caveats section of your documentation
would shrink down considerably to the point that it may even be
comprehend-able to mortal users and I don't think you will see much
resistant from overlayfs developers to that "safe side" approach.

Very interesting... that's a use case of overlayfs snapshots [1] I was
not aware of.
With regular overlayfs, mounter creds are used to create the "master" copy
while "origin" is left unchanged. With overlayfs snapshots, the "master" copy
is modified by user while the "backup" copy is created with the snapshot
mounter credentials.

Essentially, dm-bow target has the same capabilities as overlayfs driver with
mounter creds. When creating the backup copies of modified blocks, it does
not consult the per file granular security policy - not sure if that
is a security
concern? (cc: Paul Lawrence)

As a matter of fact, because the overlayfs snapshots "backup repository"
is a directory tree, granular per file security policy could be applied during
BOW and/or during commit.

That's a bold statement and not entirely true.

Overlayfs (as do overlayfs snapshots) is much more efficient in page cache
usage (for unmodified files) than btrfs snapshots and dm thinp.
There is no issue with accessing the "free blocks pool" when the snapshot
solution is at the vfs level (as opposed to block level).
In fact, these two characteristics are probably the main thing going for
overlayfs as a choice for container storage driver.

Nevertheless, it doesn't seem like the Android userdata rollback feature
should care about efficiency of snapshot access at all.

All in all, I think that dm-bow is a neat solution for the specific use case,
but do not confuse it with "built-in filesystem snapshot support".
Getting there with ext4 is much harder. I know because I tried... [2].

Thanks,
Amir.
