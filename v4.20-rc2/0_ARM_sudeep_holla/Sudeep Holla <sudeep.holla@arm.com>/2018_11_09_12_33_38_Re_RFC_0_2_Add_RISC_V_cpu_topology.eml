NO, we don't assume any knowledge about power domain and cache topology
based on the CPU topology. We have updated scheduling domains for ACPI
based systems and plan to do the same for DT. The current code may not
be optimal.

Again, that's arch specific, so I can't comment on anything other than ARM.

OK, we may use LLC for sched domains in future, we do for ACPI systems.

Better.

Yes, PPC and SPARC has lots of Open Firmware base which is different from
DT.

Sure, if you want to improve support for the existing DT bindings that's
fine. Happy to see the patches.

DT bindings can be generic, you can still interpret and manage the sched
domains in the best way for RISC-V.

Good, we are in agreement here.

No worries, glad if it helps.
