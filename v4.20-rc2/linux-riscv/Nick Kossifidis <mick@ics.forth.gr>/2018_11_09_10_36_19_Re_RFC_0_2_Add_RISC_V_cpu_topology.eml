I never said it's broken, I just assumed that if this binding becomes 
common
across archs you'd probably like to switch to it, so it should either be
backwards compatible with what you have (or as you said "keep them 
optional")
or take steps for the transition. I'm ok either way, It's not such a 
serious
thing to have the <thread> nodes supported or keep the distinction 
between
"cores", "clusters" or whatever, I'm sorry if it looked that way. I'm 
just
saying that I'd like to have something cleaner for RISC-V and/or a 
binding
that's common for all, we can support both and be backwards compatible, 
or we
can keep it as is and mandate the <thread> nodes only for ARM64 as you
suggested.

But that's what you do on arch/arm/kernel/topology.c, you assume
information on power domain and cache topology based on the CPU topology
when you define the scheduling domain topology levels.

PowerPC also does the same on arch/powerpc/kernel/smp.c and basically if
you track the usage of struct sched_domain_topology_level you'll see 
that
every arch that uses it to instruct the scheduler about the scheduling
domains, does it based on its CPU topology, which I think we both agree
is wrong.

The only use of the devicetree spec bindings for caches if I'm not
mistaken are used on your cacheinfo driver for exporting them to 
userspace
through sysfs (thank you for cleaning this up btw). Even if we have the
cache topology  using the generic bindings, we are not doing anything 
with
that information but export it to userspace.

As for the power domain bindings, we have drivers/base/power/domain.c 
that
handles the generic bindings and it's being used by some drivers to put
devices to power domains (something used by the pm code), but from a 
quick
search it's not used for cpu nodes and I didn't see this info being used
for providing hints to the scheduler either. Even with the generic power
domain bindings in place, for CPU idle states, on ARM we have another
binding that's basically the same with the addition of 
"wakeup-latency-us".

For having different capacity there is no generic binding but I guess we
could use ARM's.

Of the generic bindings that relate to the scheduler's behavior, only 
the
numa binding is used as expected and only by ARM64, powerpc and sparc 
use
their own stuff.

So there may be nothing broken regarding the generic / already existing
bindings, but their support needs fixing. The way they are now we can't
use them on RISC-V for configuring the scheduler and supporting SMT and
MC properly + I'm not in favor of using CPU topology blindly as the
other archs do.

I mentioned the script as a transitioning method, but you are right, it 
goes
both ways.

But I never said that's "the only solution and everything else is 
broken" !
I'm just proposing an extension to cpu-map since Mark suggested that 
it's
possible. My goal is to try and consolidate cpu-map with what Atish 
proposed
for RISC-V (so that we can use the same code) and point out some issues
on how we use and define the CPU topology.
