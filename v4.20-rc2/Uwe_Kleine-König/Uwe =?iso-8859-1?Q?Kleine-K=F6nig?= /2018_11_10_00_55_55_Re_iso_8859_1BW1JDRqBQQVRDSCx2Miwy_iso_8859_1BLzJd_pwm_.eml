The key is that the pinmux setting for the PWM pin should be part of the
bl pinctrl, not the pwm pinctrl. Then "default" is only setup when the
bl device is successfully bound which is after the bl's .probe callback
called pwm_apply().

With this dt snippet the effect is as you describe. But that's not what
I meant. (Also "init" should/could be empty.)

That's a valid option, too, that should work with the solution that is
implemented in the end. Both our ideas are compatible with that.

That's as pointed out above, because you're looking at the pwm's pinctrl
and I at the pwm-consumer's pinctrl.

Note that a sysfs consumer cannot be operated smoothly here, because
there is no pinctrl node to add the PWM mode to that only gets active
after the first configuration. This however is something that should not
be addressed in the imx driver but in the pwm core (if at all).

Ah right, that's something I forgot in my patch. On disable of an
inverted PWM it is necessary to configure the pwm to output a 1.
