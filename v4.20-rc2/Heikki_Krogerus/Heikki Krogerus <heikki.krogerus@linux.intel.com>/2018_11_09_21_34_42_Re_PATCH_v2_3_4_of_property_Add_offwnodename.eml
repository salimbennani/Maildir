Since the fwnode API is just a wrapper layer (at least IMO), I don't
think there should be any assumptions that it provides the optimal
solution for anything. The low-level APIs should be the ones providing
the optimal solutions.

OK. That's what we'll do then.

Side note:

I would prefer that we had something like of_node_name_get() function
that of_fwnode_get_name() could simply call. I don't know how you want
that implemented, but I'm expecting you will implement something like
that in any case once you start removing that ->name member. I figured
that at that point we can update of_fwnode_get_name() as well.

I don't think that anybody was planning to have the fwnode API as
the only available API for the drivers. It's just a helper for the
drivers on top of the low-level APIs, so the low-level APIs really
need to always stay available for the drivers. There will always be
corner cases.

I actually used stccasecmp() in the first version. I don't know how,
or why, I've changed it to strcmp(). I'll fix that.
