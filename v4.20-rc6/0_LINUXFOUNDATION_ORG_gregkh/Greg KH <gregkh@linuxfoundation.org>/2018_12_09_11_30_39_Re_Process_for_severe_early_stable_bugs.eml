Yes, this all was very helpful, thank you for the information I
appreciate it.

And I will watch out for these issues now.  It's a bit sad that these
are showing up in 4.14, but it seems that distros are only now starting
to really use that kernel version (or at least are only now starting to
report things from it), as it is a year old.  Oh well, can't do much
about that, I am more worried about the 4.19 issues like Laura was
talking about as that is the "canary" we need to watch out for more.

Isn't that what xfs and fio is?  Aren't we running this all the time and
reporting those issues?  How did this bug not show up on those tests, is
it just because they didn't run long enough?

Because of those test suites, I was thinking that the block and
filesystem paths were one of the more well-tested things we had at the
moment, is this not true?

thanks,
