Subject: [PATCH 37/75] perf vendor events intel: Fix diverse typos
Date: Thu,  6 Dec 2018 18:25:24 -0300

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@kernel.org>

Go over the tools/ files that are maintained in Arnaldo's tree and
fix common typos: half of them were in comments, the other half
in JSON files.

( Care should be taken not to re-import these typos in the future,
  if the JSON files get updated by the vendor without fixing the typos. )

No change in functionality intended.

Committer notes:

This was split from a larger patch as there are code that is,
additionally, maintained outside the kernel tree, so to ease cherry
picking and/or backporting, split this into multiple patches.
