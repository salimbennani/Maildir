The latest maintenance release Git v2.19.2 is now available at the
usual places.  This is a collection of small fixes that have been
accumulated on the primary development track, merged on top of
v2.19.1 released earlier in the year.  On the 'master' front, we are
nearing the upcoming future release, by the way.

The tarballs are found at:

    https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/

The following public repositories all have a copy of the 'v2.19.2'
tag and the 'maint' branch that the tag points at:

Git v2.19.2 Release Notes
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Fixes since v2.19.1
-------------------

 * "git interpret-trailers" and its underlying machinery had a buggy
   code that attempted to ignore patch text after commit log message,
   which triggered in various codepaths that will always get the log
   message alone and never get such an input.

 * "git rebase -i" did not clear the state files correctly when a run
   of "squash/fixup" is aborted and then the user manually amended the
   commit instead, which has been corrected.

 * When fsmonitor is in use, after operation on submodules updates
   .gitmodules, we lost track of the fact that we did so and relied on
   stale fsmonitor data.

 * Fix for a long-standing bug that leaves the index file corrupt when
   it shrinks during a partial commit.

 * Further fix for O_APPEND emulation on Windows

 * A corner case bugfix in "git rerere" code.

 * "git add ':(attr:foo)'" is not supported and is supposed to be
   rejected while the command line arguments are parsed, but we fail
   to reject such a command line upfront.

 * "git rebase" etc. in Git 2.19 fails to abort when given an empty
   commit log message as result of editing, which has been corrected.

 * The code to backfill objects in lazily cloned repository did not
   work correctly, which has been corrected.

 * Update error messages given by "git remote" and make them consistent.

 * "git update-ref" learned to make both "--no-deref" and "--stdin"
   work at the same time.

 * Recently added "range-diff" had a corner-case bug to cause it
   segfault, which has been corrected.

 * The recently introduced commit-graph auxiliary data is incompatible
   with mechanisms such as replace & grafts that "breaks" immutable
   nature of the object reference relationship.  Disable optimizations
   based on its use (and updating existing commit-graph) when these
   incompatible features are in use in the repository.

 * The mailmap file update.

 * The code in "git status" sometimes hit an assertion failure.  This
   was caused by a structure that was reused without cleaning the data
   used for the first run, which has been corrected.

 * A corner-case bugfix.

 * A partial clone that is configured to lazily fetch missing objects
   will on-demand issue a "git fetch" request to the originating
   repository to fill not-yet-obtained objects.  The request has been
   optimized for requesting a tree object (and not the leaf blob
   objects contained in it) by telling the originating repository that
   no blobs are needed.

 * The codepath to support the experimental split-index mode had
   remaining "racily clean" issues fixed.

 * "git log --graph" showing an octopus merge sometimes miscounted the
   number of display columns it is consuming to show the merge and its
   parent commits, which has been corrected.

 * The implementation of run_command() API on the UNIX platforms had a
   bug that caused a command not on $PATH to be found in the current
   directory.

 * A mutex used in "git pack-objects" were not correctly initialized
   and this caused "git repack" to dump core on Windows.

 * Under certain circumstances, "git diff D:/a/b/c D:/a/b/d" on
   Windows would strip initial parts from the paths because they
   were not recognized as absolute, which has been corrected.

 * The receive.denyCurrentBranch=3DupdateInstead codepath kicked in even
   when the push should have been rejected due to other reasons, such
   as it does not fast-forward or the update-hook rejects it, which
   has been corrected.

 * "git repack" in a shallow clone did not correctly update the
   shallow points in the repository, leading to a repository that
   does not pass fsck.

 * Operations on promisor objects make sense in the context of only a
   small subset of the commands that internally use the revisions
   machinery, but the "--exclude-promisor-objects" option were taken
   and led to nonsense results by commands like "log", to which it
   didn't make much sense.  This has been corrected.

 * The "container" mode of TravisCI is going away.  Our .travis.yml
   file is getting prepared for the transition.

 * Our test scripts can now take the '-V' option as a synonym for the
   '--verbose-log' option.

 * A regression in Git 2.12 era made "git fsck" fall into an infinite
   loop while processing truncated loose objects.

Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.
