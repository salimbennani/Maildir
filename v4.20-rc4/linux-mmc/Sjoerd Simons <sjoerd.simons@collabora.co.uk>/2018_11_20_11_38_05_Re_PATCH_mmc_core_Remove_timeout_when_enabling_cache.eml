Not an incredibly strong opinion either; I just wonder if it's the
right trade-off. 

If the quirk/work-around is not there while it should be, the impact is
that you get an unusable card (which for eMMC is likely to mean a
failure to boot the system). Which is somewhat unfortunate.

If the work-around is there while it's not needed then there doesn't
seem to be much of an impact at all; Apart from it not being reported
to the user/developer/kernel community? 

In which case it might make more to put in a warning iff the card takes
too long with a list of cards for which this is known?

For the card in question it happens only on hard power off; The time it
takes seems correlated to the state of the cache at hard power off (It
takes substantially longer if there was a lot of I/O activity at 
 the time of hard power off). With light I/O activity the current
timeout is sometimes enough.

So if you know the pattern, or just happen to hit it often in e.g.
automated testing, it does show up during development. Otherwise it can
appear to "happen once in a while randomly".

Unfortunately for me, it was really a case of getting reports of some
boards started failing at some point which took a while to track back.
Especially since it's a battery powered device (thus hard poweroffs are
rather rare) and we allow the board manufactorer to select from various
different eMMCs depending on price/available at build time...

Yes please. It would be nice if someone happens to have the right
contacts with Micron to see if it's a known issue for their cards in
general or just this one.

Also would be good to have a timeout higher then 1 seconds (or for
these cards not have one?); On our testing thusfar we've seen timeouts
up to 850ms, but it's impossible to ensure that that's the true upper
bound.
