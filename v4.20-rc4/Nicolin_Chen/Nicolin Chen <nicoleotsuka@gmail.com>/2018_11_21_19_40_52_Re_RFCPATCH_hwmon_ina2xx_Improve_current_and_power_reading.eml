Hi Stefan,

Thank you for the comments.

Chip can enter power-down or one-shot mode. Though this upstream
driver doesn't have these two mode supports yet, I am working on
it so they'll be added.

Just found out that I have typos here: 25mW and 62.5mW.

Current read doesn't get affected a lot actually, since hwmon ABI
also reports current value in unit mA. However, the power read is
the matter here. With a 62.5mW power_lsb, power results are kinda
useless on my system.

I understand your last point. But I believe that'd be a separate
idea to improve precision but not an alternative one from driver
aspect. Yes, I agree using a larger shunt resistor is always one
way to get precision, but it doesn't give an excuse for software
driver to be less optimized.

The truth is that calibration value is set to the minimum value,
giving the best range of current measurement meanwhile the worst
precision. You can argue that our hardware engineers might have
been too conservative by putting a not-big-enough resistor. But
they may also argue that software driver doesn't optimize while
the register is totally configurable. I believe both sides have
their own reasons.

But apparently configuring in software is fairly less expensive.
And it doesn't sound convincing to me by telling them "hey guys,
go to change your hardware design because we will not set that
register": We have more than thousands of products in the market
(all battery powered so being conservative), so not possible to
recall all of them back just to place larger shunt resistors.

From my point of view, there's nothing wrong for hardware folks
being conservative to put a smaller resistor since the software
has the capability to improve precision with a single I2C write.

A separate topic, I actually thought about setting the default
calibration value using a number somewhere in the middle of the
best range and the best precision. But it looks that I am right
to keep the default to minimum value so that no existing users
will be affected.

So my patch merely gives an opportunity for those conservative
designers to fine-tune the software for a better precision. It
is necessary since there are such designers/users and products.
And it isn't supposed to affect existing users.

Thank you
Nicolin
