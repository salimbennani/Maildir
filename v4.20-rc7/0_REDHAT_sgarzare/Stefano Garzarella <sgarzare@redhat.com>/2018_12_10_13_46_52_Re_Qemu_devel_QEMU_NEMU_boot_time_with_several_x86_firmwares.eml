Yes, you are right!

I'm looking in Firecracker and they use the same approach of qemu-lite
to load the Linux kernel:
1. load ELF image (vmlinux)
2. setup zero page in VMM code (eg. command line)
3. setup VM registers  (eg. ESI = zero page address, EIP = ELF entry_point, etc)
4. start VM (ELF entry_point = phys_startup_64)

Stefano
