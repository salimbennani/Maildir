When the baseline improvement is roughly 2x (because you can double N
in make -jN), I consider 10-20% "marginal". Obviously there's a
perspective where 10-20% is huge. Have you actually observed x32 gcc
(since gcc is the example I'm using here, where it makes a big
difference) running that much faster than i386 gcc, though?

What I meant by "widely supported" is that pretty much any kernel
that's shipped can run i386 binaries. On the other hand, at least as I
understand it,lots of distros have x32 disabled because it's "not
used" or because there were a couple historic vulns exposed by having
it enabled and they just decided it wasn't worth it.

OK, so we're on the same page there.

No, I'm not really taking a position here except that i386 (IA32)
should not be removed. I agree that x32 is useful (which a lot of
people are wrongly dismissing), but I also agree that the kernel code
for it is a mess and a maintenance burden, and I'm not sure if the
usefulness justifies that burden. I think it's really helpful to hear
from people like you who are using it why you care that it's there.
