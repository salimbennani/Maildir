In that thread, you seem to have mentioned that having a Kconfig
option, disabled by default, to allow registering an incomplete media
topology would be an acceptable option. Do you think we could revive
that idea?

Quoting some of the discussion points you mentioned:

Some discussion points:

It sounds like an interesting extension, not a must have for handling
incomplete topologies.

I can also imagine the timeout handling introducing a lot of confusion
to the userspace, for example, with a long timeout, the whole
initialization would have to wait for the timeout to elapse, which for
a smartphone user could mean that they can't start the camera
application (or it times out on its own and fails) until then.

This is a very good point, but I think we should be able to do away
with something simpler, just blacklist particular device from being
bound to a driver. How to do it, is another question, though... (I can
imagine binding a dummy driver to the device as an example solution.)

Best regards,
Tomasz
