Yes. Maybe a "Review Forum" section for subsystems that have
transitioned from email to a web-based tool? There's also the
exception of security disclosures, but the expectations for those
patches are already documented.

Yes, and perhaps I should clarify that this is the point at which a
maintainer will start to push back in the typical case, and indicate
to a contributor that they are standing in exceptional territory.
Similar to how later in the -rc series patches get increasing
scrutiny.

The intent is to try to leave all "should" or prescriptive statements
out of the profile. I'm looking to target other parts of the handbook
to carry advice for integrating with -next and suggested soak times.

This is intended to go beyond maintainer self-commits. Consider a pull

Per the clarification above, I think the whole thing should be called
"Review Tags Requirement".

Ok, this sounds like a separate policy. How often to follow-up
separated from resend the full series vs send a ping mail.

Would it be worthwhile to have separate Subsystem Profiles for those
API reviewers? If they end up merging patches and sending them
upstream might we need a hierarchy of profiles for each hop along the
upstream merge path?

For that case just say:

Yeah, maybe:

"outside of weekends or holidays there's usually a maintainer or
reviewer monitoring the mailing list"
