So we'd still have to use jiffies + interpolation from the current timer 
rundown counter as clocksource (since that will be monotonous and won't 
wrap)?

The way Finn did the clocksource for m68k, the clocksource counter does 
behave as it should (monotonous, doesn't wrap) at least so far as I've 
tested. Using the same timer for clocksource and clock events will 
degrade timekeeping based on timer events to jiffies resolution, as you 
point out. That would already have been the case before, so no gain in 
resolution. Other timekeeping would have worked at higher resolution 
before (interpolating through arch_gettimeoffset) just the same as now 
(interpolating through clocksource reads). Finn's clocksource read code 
essentially is arch_gettimeoffset under a new name.

Are you saying that's not possible on arm, because the current timer 
rundown counter can't be read while the timer is running?

If I were to run a second timer at higher rate for clocksource, but 
keeping the 10 ms timer as clock event (could easily do that by using 
timer D on Atari Falcon) - how would that improve my timekeeping? Clock 
events still only happen 10 ms apart ...

Cheers,
