Documentation/leds/leds-class.txt in a description of
"devicename:colour:function" naming scheme states the following:

"If sections of the name don't apply, just leave that section blank"

Currently not many Device Tree nodes follow that recommendation but with
the led_compose_name() I'm going to enforce it (only for the
devicename-less naming scheme), which is needed for reliable parsing of
LED color and function, which with naming schemes you proposed it
wouldn't be possible.

But, even with led_compose_name(), it will be possible to get the
names listed by you:

If you provide the 'label' property in the DT, then with the new
led_compose_name() you will get the LED class device name in one of the
two below forms, depending on the parameters passed to the function:
- If led_hw_name argument is not NULL:
	led_hw_name:label
- If led_hw_name argument is NULL then the label is taken as-is for
  for LED class device name (it may be appended a numerical suffix if
  the name is already taken)

This flexibility is for backwards compatibility with existing drivers,
where some of them add devicename section to the parsed DT label,
and others adopts the DT label as-is for LED class device name,
relying on DT to provide the devicename.

Please get acquainted with the entire patch set, the commit messages,
and the documentation of led_compose_name(). You'll find out that
this is exactly how led_compose_name() is designed.

Color must not be omitted as explained above. Of course in case 'label'
is provided, it won't be validated in any way, thus allowing for any
combination. With the 'color' and/or 'function' DT properties you'll
get one of the following:

- color:function
- :function
- color:

Having considered all the above, I'd even propose to change the
delimiter for the new naming convention from ":" to "-", to make it
possible to distinguish between old and new naming convention.

devicename section is problematic in the LED class device name,
since it doesn't allow for having uniform userspace interface across
different platforms. Think of Android - I've seen they have their own
LED naming scheme which doesn't contain devicename section.

Also, please refer to the DT maintainer's opinion in this regard [0],
which actually drew my attention to the problem.

Please keep in mind that devicename has been so far used for
board vendor name or LED controller name.

You mean we don't need the color information at all?

And could you please explain what do you mean by "location prefix"?
