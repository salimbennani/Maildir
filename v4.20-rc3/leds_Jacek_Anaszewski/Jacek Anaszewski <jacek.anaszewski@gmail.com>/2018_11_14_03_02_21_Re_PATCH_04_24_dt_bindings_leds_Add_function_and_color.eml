We have just contributed pattern trigger - it could be adjusted
to RGB LED purposes too.

See drivers/leds/trigger/ledtrig-pattern.c and
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-trigger-pattern in
Linus' tree.

I didn't make myself clear enough - I like the approach with the
color sysfs file. By the "color brightness" I mean color arrays,
that would have to be defined per each color. Elements of such an
array would make the "color brightness/lightness" range.

I think that we've just agreed the preliminary requirements for
a new RGB LED class interface.
