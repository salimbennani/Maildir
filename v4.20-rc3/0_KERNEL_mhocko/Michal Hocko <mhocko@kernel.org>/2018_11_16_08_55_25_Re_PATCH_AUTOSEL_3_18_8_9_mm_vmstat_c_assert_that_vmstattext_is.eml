Let me quote "I found this bug by reading the code." I do not think
anybody has ever seen this in practice.

Memory hotplug locking is dubious at best and this patch doesn't really
fix it. It fixes a theoretical problem. I am not aware anybody would be
hitting in practice. We need to rework the locking quite extensively.

The patch makes sense I just do not think this is a stable material. The
semantic of the event was and still is suboptimal.

It would be much better to ask in the respective email thread rather
than spamming mailing with AUTOSEL patches which rarely get any
attention.

We have been through this discussion several times already and I thought
we have agreed that those subsystems which are seriously considering stable
are opted out from the AUTOSEL automagic. Has anything changed in that
regards.
