There is nothing like that proposed in this series.

And we do that in the reclaim path.

Sigh. No, this is not the case. All this patch series does is that we
hand over to the exiting task once it doesn't block on any locks
anymore. If the thread is low priority then it is quite likely that the
oom reaper is done by the time the victim even reaches the exit path.

OK, I stopped reading right here. This discussion is pointless. Once you
busy loop all CPUs you are screwed. Are you going to blame a filesystem
that no progress can be made if a code path holding an important lock
is preemempted by high priority stuff a no further progress can be
made? This is just ridiculous. What you are arguing here is not fixable
with the current upstream kernel. Even your so beloved timeout based
solution doesn't cope with that because oom reaper can be preempted for
unbound amount of time. Your argument just doens't make much sense in
the context of the current kernel. Full stop.
