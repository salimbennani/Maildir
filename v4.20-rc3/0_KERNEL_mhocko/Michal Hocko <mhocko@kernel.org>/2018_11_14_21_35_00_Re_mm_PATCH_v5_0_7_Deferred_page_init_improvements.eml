There is still that zone device special casing which I have brought up
previously but I reckon this is out of scope of this series.

I see the performance argument. I also do see the maintenance burden
argument. Recent bootmem removal has shown how big and hard to follow
the whole API is. And this should be considered. I am not saying the
current series is a nogo though. Maybe changelogs should be more clear
to spell out advantages to do a per-pageblock initialization that brings
a lot of new code in. As I've said I have basically glanced through
the comulative diff and changelogs to get an impression so it is not
entirely clear to me.  Especially when the per block init does per pfn
within the block init anyway.

That being said, I belive changelogs should be much more specific and
I hope to see this to be a much more modest in the added code. If that
is not possible, then fair enough, but I would like to see it tried.
And please let's not build on top of cargocult and rather get rid of
pointless stuff (e.g. PageReserved) rather than go around it.
