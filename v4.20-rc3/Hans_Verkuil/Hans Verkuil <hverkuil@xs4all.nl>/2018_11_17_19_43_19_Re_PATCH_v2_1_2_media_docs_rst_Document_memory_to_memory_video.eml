Yes, I was talking about all V4L2 codecs.

How would such a codec handle resolution changes? Or is that not allowed?

This is all useful information, thank you.

I think I stand by my recommendation to add a statement that we don't
support such codecs at the moment. When we add support for such a codec,
then we will need to update the spec with the right rules.

I think it is difficult to make assumptions without having seen how a
typical stateful HW codec would handle this.
