Well, the timer will get deleted when the hub is unplugged.  If that
doesn't happen, we can assume that the hub has retained its state and
so a reset isn't necessary.

I would just keep retrying at, say, 1-second intervals.  Don't even 
bother with the exponential slowdown that the HID driver does.

You could even rename the timer to something like irq_urb_retry; I 
think that would be a more accurate description of what it does.

So fix those things up, simplify the retries, and expand the patch
description -- then resubmit.  :-)
