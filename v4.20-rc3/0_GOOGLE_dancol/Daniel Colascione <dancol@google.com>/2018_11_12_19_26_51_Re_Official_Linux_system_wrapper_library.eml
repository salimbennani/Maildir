No, I wouldn't make callers go to that trouble. I don't see any
barrier to common-sense local data transformations. These
transformations don't have external dependencies, after all. I want a
thin interface to the kernel, but not so thin as to be a direct
mapping onto register locations. I don't see value in that level of
correspondence.

This is another example in which we should remember the old aphorism
that the perfect is the enemy of the good. There's no reason that the
kernel couldn't simply provide a library with conventional functions
exported in the conventional way doing the conventional things that
functions do, one that would free users from relying on direct use of
syscall(2). If this library were to interact with errno and
cancelation properly, so much the better. There's no reason to avoid
this work in favor of some theoretically-elegant
abstract-function-description metadata-based approach that will likely
never materialize.

(Alternatively: just regard C as the uniform description language.)

The two features *are* unrelated. The design I've proposed works
equally well for synchronous and asynchronous signals, and limiting it
to synchronous signals doesn't simplify it. Even if it were the case
that the design were simpler and easier to use when limited to
synchronous signals --- which it isn't, unless you want to go in the
SEH direction, which is more, not less complicated --- that wouldn't
be a reason to block the work until some form of process handle
landed. The objections I've seen have all essentially amounted to "we
don't think people should use signals".
