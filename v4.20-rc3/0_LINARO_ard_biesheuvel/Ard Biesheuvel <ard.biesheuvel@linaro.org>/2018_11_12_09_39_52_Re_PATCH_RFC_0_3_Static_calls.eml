Having looked into this, I don't think they will share any code at
all, to be honest. Perhaps some macros and string templates, that's
all.

What would arm64 gain from ORC and/or objtool?

Is this about the reliable stack traces, i.e., the ability to detect
non-leaf functions that don't create stack frames? I think we should
be able to manage this without objtool on arm64 tbh.

I tend to agree here. I think objtool is a necessary evil (as are
compiler plugins, for that matter) which I hope does not spread to
other architectures.

But the main difference is that the GCC plugin is only ~50 lines (for
this particular use case, and minus another 50 lines of boilerplate),
whereas objtool (AIUI) duplicates lots and lots of functionality of
the compiler, assembler and/or linker, to mangle relocations, create
new sections etc etc. Porting this to other architectures is going to
be a major maintenance effort, especially when I think of, e.g.,
32-bit ARM with its Thumb2 quirks and other idiosyncrasies that are
currently hidden in the toolchain. Other architectures should be first
class citizens if objtool gains support for them, which means that the
x86 people that own it currently are on the hook for testing their
changes against architectures they are not familiar with.

This obviously applies equally to compiler plugins, but those have a
lot more focus.
