It's engineering slang for "I don't know what the spec says, but do what =
=0A=
the spec says." What it means is that FW should set up HW in such a way, =
=0A=
that PCIe-compliant OS which enables interrupts will get interrupts the =0A=
way it expects. For example, some FW might set the root port to trigger =0A=
an SMI instead of firing up the proper MSI vector. In this case FW must =0A=
ensure that AER interrupts fire up the MSI vector instead of triggering SMI=

=0A=
When OS takes control of AER, it is responsible for setting things up, =0A=
at least as far as standard PCIe registers are concerned. So setting up =0A=
the the root command register would still be the OS's responsibility. =0A=
Proprietary registers, like routing to SMI/SCI/MSI would have to be done =
=0A=
by FW.=0A=

=0A=
The connection with FFS is that FFS needs to be notified by some other =0A=
method. FW can't commandeer interrupt vectors willie-nillie. FW gets =0A=
notified by platform-specific mechanisms. In my case, it happens to be =0A=
SMM, but it could be a number of other proprietary mechanisms.=0A=

"This table contains information platform firmware supplies to OSPM for =0A=
configuring AER support on a given PCI Express device."=0A=
=0A=
I don't fully get the point of the HEST structures for PCIe. I'm hoping =0A=
Borislav can shed enlightment on this. I think we can ignore them in PCI =
=0A=
core, with a note to revisit them if something ever goes horribly wrong. =

I think that's a reasonable assumption as long as OS respects AER ownership=

Sounds like VMD is qualified to become part of ACPI spec.=0A=

I'll have to look into VMD in more detail, but this sounds like a design =

flaw. It's possible to use the values in HEST to set up AER, but that =0A=
might conflict with the OS's wish on how to set up AER.=0A=
