Hi Keith,

Good to see another attempt at this, particularly thinking about simplifying
what is provided to make it easier to use.

I need to have a bit of a think about how this maps onto more complex
topologies, but some initial comments / questions in the meantime.

I think this statement should be more specific.  The requirement is that
it should have similar CPU locality and performance characteristics wrt
to every initiator in the system, not just the local one.

When multiple initiators exist, they may not all show the same performance
when accessing a given memory target.

One of, or the only?   Are we allowing a many to one mapping if several
initiators have the same performance but are in different nodes?

Also, what is your measure of performance, latency or bandwidth or some
combination of the two?

ls on initiator* is giving targetY?

Just to check as I'm not clear, do we have self links when the 
memory and initiators are in the same node?

My worry here is we are explicitly making an interface that is only ever
providing "local" node information, where local node is not the best
defined thing in the world for complex topologies.

I have no problem with that making a sensible starting point for providing
information userspace knows what to do with, just with an interface that
in of itself doesn't make that clear.

Perhaps something as simple as
/sys/devices/system/nodeY/local_initiatorX
/sys/devices/system/nodeX/local_targetY

That leaves us the option of coming along later and having a full listing
when a userspace requirement has become clear.  Another option would
be an exhaustive list of all initiator / memory pairs that exist, with
an additional sysfs file giving a list of those that are nearest
to avoid every userspace program having to do the search.

Thanks,

Jonathan
