I guess this is true on almost all subsystems that accept pull requests.

It could not be true if some subsystem moves to Github/Gitlab.

That's only partially true. I mean, the usual flux is to go up to -rc7.
After that, the final version is usually merged (except when something
goes wrong).

Anyway, I guess nobody would complain if the maintainers do an exception
here and accept more patches when they know that the last rc version
won't be -rc7, but, instead, -rc8 or -rc9.

This is a general ruleset that describes the usual behavior, telling the
developers the expected behavior. If the maintainers can do more on some
particular development cycle, it should be fine.

That depends on how maintainers handle patches. Those subsystems that
use patchwork (like media) don't really require anyone to resubmit
patches. They're all stored there at patchwork database.

My workflow is that, if I receive two patches from the same person with
the same subject, I simply mark the first one as obsoleted, as usually=20
the second one is a new version, and reviewers should need some
time to handle it.=20

In other words, re-sending a patch may actually delay its handling, as
the second version will be later on my input queue, and I'll grant
additional time for people to review the second version at the community.

Well, on subsystems that have sub-maintainers, there's no way to point to
it at MAINTAINERS file.

Also, not sure about others, but I usually avoid touching at existing
MAINTAINERS file entries. This is a file that everyone touches, so it
has higher chances of conflicts.

Also, at least on media, we have 5 different API sets (digital TV, V4L2, CE=
C,
media controller, remote controller). Yet, all drivers are stored at the
same place (as a single driver may use multiple APIs).

The reviewers for each API set are different. There isn't a good way
to explain that inside a MAINTANERS file.

Frankly, for media, I don't think that working hours makes sense. Media=20
(sub-)maintainers are spread around the globe, on different time zones
(in US, Brazil and Europe). We also have several active developers in
Japan, so we may end by having some day reviewers/sub-maintainers from
there.

At max, we can say that we won't warrant to patches on weekends or holidays.
