Maybe. I would postpone adding a section like that until some
subsystem maintainer that actually changed to Github/Gitlab
would submit his subsystem profile.

Makes sense. There's one issue, though.

I don't expect developers to read the profile template, as this is a
material for the maintainer themselves. Developers should likely read=20
just the specific subsystem profile for the patches that will be submitted.

So, either each subsystem profile should have a reference to the
profile template, or need to copy some "invariant" texts (with would be
really painful to maintain).

Makes sense. Again, it probably makes sense to have those parts
referenced on each profile.

I guess having hierarchical profiles will make it very confusing.
The point is: inside a subsystem, the same ruleset usually applies to
everything.

In the case of media, it is not uncommon to have patches that require
multiple APIs. Consider, for example, a SoC used on a TV box. The driver
itself should be placed at drivers/media/platform/, but it will end by
being a bunch of sub-drivers that together will add support for V4L,=20
Digital TV, remote controller, CEC and codecs, and need to be controlled
via the media controller API. It may even have camera sensors.

On other words, all media APIs will be used (after having it fully
sent upstream).

In practice, drivers for complex hardware like that is submitted in
parts. For example, one SoC vendor started sending us the remote
controller driver (as it would be the simplest one).

The only part of the policy that changes, depending of what API
is involved, is the one that will do the review.=20

As the driver itself will be at the same place, no matter what APIs
are used, get_maintainers.pl is not capable of identifying who are=20
the reviewers based "F:" tags[1].

[1] It could be possible to teach get_maintainers to better hint it,
by making it look who are the reviewers for the headers that are=20
included.

Well, 24/7, there is always patchwork monitoring the ML and picking
the patches. When the patch will be handled by someone is a different
question. As it is a high-traffic subsystem with an even higher ML
traffic, each sub-maintainer have its own policy about when they
review patches (usually one or twice per week - as most maintainers
are also active developers, and don't want to mix their development
time with reviewing time).

I'm not quite sure about what you expect with this specific part of
the profile.

I mean: why a submitter should care about office hours?

Also, people may be OOT during some period of time, or working
remotely from some other office.

Except if the idea would be to point to some site that would
dynamically track each maintainer's weekly maintainership
window (with would be a real pain to keep updated), I guess this
is useless.

Thanks,
