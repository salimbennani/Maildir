What used to happen is that drivers would be written out of tree
without review of their bindings until mainline submission (if they
submit them at all).  With schema a driver writer who is working out
of tree can use the schema to validate their new device tree entries
before submitting them. That way they will know ahead of time if they
are making up something non-standard. It will also give them the heads
up that they can't just make up anything they want in the device tree
and that they are going to have to defend their design when asking for
the schema to be changed to support it. An example of where schema
would have been initially valuable is in the i2c bindings which
contain significant variation but the function is the same.

Maybe we are thinking about schema differently. I had envisioned
starting from a base generic schema that is capable of validating all
possible legal Linux device trees. This schema is more strict that
YAML syntax, but it obviously can't validate in detail.  Someone
working out of tree would always be able to validate against this
schema.

As this generic schema validates the device tree it will discover that
it can utilize more strict schema fragments. So by providing these
fragments you can validate to any desired level of conformance. The
end of that process is the json-schema bindings file. But if those
fragments are missing you can still validate, just not at a detailed
level.

A large set of schemas that work like this are used in ONVIF (security
cameras). A flavor of SOAP.
https://www.onvif.org/profiles/specifications/
These schemas are using XML stylesheets to make them pretty, use view
source to see the actual schemas.

The ONVIF schemas define points where vendors are allowed to insert
arbitrary items (ANY elements) and then they will use a vendor
supplied schema to validate the fragment if one is available. If not
the generic schema is used to validate the basic structure of the
vendor fragments.
