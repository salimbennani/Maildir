Yeah, though it would be quite simple to get the same data with a simple
awk script at link time.

I think this would be somewhere between very difficult and impossible to
do properly.  I can't even imagine how this would be implemented in a
compiler plugin.  But I'd love to be proven wrong on that.

Fair enough.  Smatch's call tree isn't perfect anyway, but I don't think
perfect is attainable.
