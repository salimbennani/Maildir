Hi Linus,

Sorry about the late reply, this one got buried in the mailbox during
conference travels.

Right.

Sure, but there's no way to guarantee that (consider pluggable devices)
unless you encode the topology in the name.

Oh, that's right.

Which effectively means you cannot have a driver provide default line
names, as that would cause conflicts if there are ever more than one
such device in a system (be it i2c or pluggable USB).

No, I don't think that's needed or desirable.

But take the concrete use case at hand; a gpio controller connected over
USB. These FTDI devices exposes four gpios on a set of pins that differ
from model to model. On some devices these lines are available on a set
of pins named CBUS0..CBUS3, on others a different set of pins such as
ACBUS5, ACBUS6, ACBUS8 and ACBUS9 are used.

Exporting which line is exposed on which pin obviously has some worth,
but this is currently not possible due to the requirement that line
names must be unique.

Having an interface that allows you to look up say ACBUS6 given a
particular gpiochip would also be useful to have (user space knows which
USB device it is interested in so finding the gpiochip is straight
forward).

Perhaps the chardev interface could return a set of matched gpiochips if
a particular line name is found on several chips for user space to
iterate over.

Essentially what I'm going for is to have the line names only be
required to be unique per chip, and let user space deal with any
collisions.

The flat line name space really only works for something like DT, and
then only if you actually have access to the DTS (I'm assuming there's
no uniqueness requirement in the binding docs?).

But you could still run into trouble if an i2c driver provides default
names, or if you use anything pluggable.

Right, this specifically prevents using line names with pluggable
devices.

The problem is that the line names are used in sysfs as device names
(file names) instead of "gpioN" whenever a line name has been specified.
So on systems with line names defined, we would definitely risk
regressions if we simply stopped exporting gpios using those names.

Doing so for a subset of devices (e.g. i2c, or anything connected over a
slow bus) may still be considered though. That would also deal with the
USB case.

But again, I'm not sure if we'd run into other problems with the chardev
interface (e.g. what happens if I lookup "CBUS3" and there are more than
one match?).

Thanks,
Johan
