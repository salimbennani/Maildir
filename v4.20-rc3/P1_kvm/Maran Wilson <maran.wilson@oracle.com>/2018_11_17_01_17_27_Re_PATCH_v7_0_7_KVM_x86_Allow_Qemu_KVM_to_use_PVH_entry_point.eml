Hi Paolo,

Thank you for the reminder. Sorry, I have been wanting to continue this 
work for a while now, but our team has been pulled in other directions 
and this one ended up getting temporarily pushed down the priority stack.

Let me discuss with my management and get back to you. I do want (and 
intend) to support and push this over the finish line.

In the meantime, if there are any folks out there with a specific 
business need for getting this done sooner rather than later and are 
able to invest a bit of time to collaborate on the remaining Qemu work, 
please feel free to ping me offline. We have some preliminary Qemu 
patches, but there is some additional work needed before they are ready 
wider review.

Thanks,
-Maran
