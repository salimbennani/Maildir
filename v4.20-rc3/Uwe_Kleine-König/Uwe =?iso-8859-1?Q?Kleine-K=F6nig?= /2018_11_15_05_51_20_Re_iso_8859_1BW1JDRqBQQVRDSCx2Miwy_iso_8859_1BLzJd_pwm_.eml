This is news to me. Adding Linus W. to Cc, maybe he can comment?!

Grepping through the arm device trees it really seems common to put the
pinctrl for the pwm pin into the pwm device. I didn't search in depth,
but I didn't find a counter example.

For GPIOs it is common that the pinmuxing is included in the GPIO's
consumer pinctrl. Ditto for mdio busses whose pinctrl is included in the
ethernet pinctrl.

Note that this problem goes away nicely if the pwm pin is attached to
the backlight. Because it's the backlight's driver that "knows" when the
pwm is configured correctly and so the already existing mechanisms that
setup the mux when the bl is correctly probed do the right thing at the
right time.

Ditto if the pwm pinctrl is attached to the consumer without having to
introduce new pwm-specific stuff.

OK, sysfs is the only point where the "put pinctrl stuff into the pwm
core (or driver)" is superior to the already existing and otherwise
completely working status quo. (Apart from bugs that need fixing in
your scenario, too.)

Given that I would not want to encourage people to stick to the sysfs
interface for their use case, that's ok IMHO. (And note that with the
bootloader's help you can even do this in a smooth way today.)

Other than that my approach looks more elegant to me (which obviously is
subjective). It works in all cases apart from sysfs (which is special
because it's not integrated into the device model) and there is no need
to teach the pwm framework about pinmuxing and invent new pinctrl modes
for it. Also dts writes don't need to lookup the needed GPIO numbers
and pinctrl.

Best regards
Uwe
