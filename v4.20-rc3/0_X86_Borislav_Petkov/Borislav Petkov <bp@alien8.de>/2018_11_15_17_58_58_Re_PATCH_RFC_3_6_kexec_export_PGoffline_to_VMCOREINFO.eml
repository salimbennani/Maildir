No, I appreciate an explanation very much! So thanks for that. :)

Yeah but that ship has sailed. And even if we had a great idea, we'd
have to support kdump before and after the idea. And that would be a
serious mess.

And if you have a huge box with gazillion piles of memory and an alpha
particle passes through a bunch of them on its way down to the earth's
core, and while doing so, flips a bunch of bits, you need to go and
collect all those regions and update some list which you then need to
shove into the second kernel.

And you probably need to do all that through perhaps a piece of memory
which is used for communication between first and second kernel and that
list better fit in there, or you need to realloc. And that piece of
memory's layout needs to be properly defined so that the second kernel
can parse it correctly.

And so on...

Yap.

Well, AFAICT, the minimum work you need to always do before starting the
dumping is somehow generate that list of pages or ranges to not dump.
And that work needs to be done by the first or the second kernel, I'd
say.

If the first kernel would do it, then you'd have to probably have
callbacks to certain operations which go and add ranges or pages to
exclude, to a list which is then readily accessible to the second
kernel. Which means, when you reserve memory for the second kernel,
you'd have to reserve memory also for such a list.

But then what do you do when that memory gets filled up...?

So I guess exporting those things in vmcoreinfo is probably the only
thing we *can* do in the end.

Oh well, enough rambling... :)
