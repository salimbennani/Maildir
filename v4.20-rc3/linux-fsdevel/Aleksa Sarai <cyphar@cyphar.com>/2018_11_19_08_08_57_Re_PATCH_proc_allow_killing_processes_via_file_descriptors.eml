I think combining it all into one API is going to be a soft re-invention
of ioctls, but specifically for procfds. This would be an improvement
over just ioctls (since the current ioctl namespacing is based on
well-behaved drivers and hoping we never have more than 256 ioctl
drivers), but I'm not sure it would help make the API nicer than having
separate syscalls (we'd have to do something similar to bpf(2) which I'm
not a huge fan of).

I believe this is precisely what Christian is trying to do with this
patch (and you say as much later in your mail).

I think that adding all of {sighand,sighand_exitcode,kill,...} would not
help the path of landing a much larger API change. We should instead
think about the API we want at the end of the day, and then land smaller
changes which are long-term compatible (and won't just become deprecated
APIs -- there's far too many of them, let's not add more needlessly).

If the plan is to have an ioctl API we should merge minor ioctls first.
If the idea is to have an explosion of syscalls, then we should merge
minor syscalls first. We shouldn't merge procfiles if the end goal is to
not use them.

I agree with you on this need. I will admit I do somewhat like the EOF
solution (mainly because it seamlessly deals with the multi-reader case)
but I'm still not sure I like /proc/$pid/exit_sighand. As mentioned in
the other discussion, ideally we would be only ever operating with the=20

An ugly strawman of an alternative would be an interface that gave you
an fd that you could similarly wait-until-EOF on, but that's probably
not a major API improvement unless we also make said API provide exit
status information in a way that works with the
multiple-readers-with-different-creds usecase.

One other thing I think we should eventually consider is to provide an
API which pings a listener whenever a process does an execve() (and
possibly fork()). This is something you can get from FreeBSD's kqueue --
and is something that we have in a really neutered form in the "proc
connector". But of course we can discuss this separately, especially if
we have an extensible API idea in mind when we start.
