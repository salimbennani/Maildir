Okay. That has nothing to do with exit status. Please address the
points related to the API we're discussing and that I raised in the
other thread.

Assuming we don't broaden exit status readability (which would make a
lot of things simpler), the exit notification mechanism must work like
this: if you can see a process in /proc, you should be able to wait on
it. If you learn that process's exit status through some other means
--- e.g., you're the process's parent, you can ptrace the process, you
have CAP_WHATEVER_IT_IS_ --- then you should be able to learn the fate
of the process. Otherwise you just be able to learn that the process
exited.

>  Windows has an easy time of it because

Windows has an easier time of it because it doesn't use an ad-hoc
ambient authority permission model. In Windows, if you can open a
handle to do something, that handle lets you do the thing. Period.
There's none of this "well, I opened this process FD, but since I
opened it, the process called setuid, so now I can't get its exit
status" nonsense. Privilege elevation is always accomplished via a
separate call to CreateProcessWithToken, which creates a *new* process
with the elevated privileges. An existing process can't suddenly and
magically become this special thing that you can't inspect, but that
has the same PID and identity as this other process that you used to
be able to inspect. The model is just better, because permission is
baked into the HANDLE. Now, that ship has sailed. We're stuck with
setreuid and exec. But let's be clear about what's causing the
complexity.
