First of all, I welcome documentation efforts like this.

The cover letter mainly focuses on the maintainer aspect, and the
documentation is added to the maintainer handbook. However, here you set
the goal as setting expectations for contributors. The example nvdimm
profile in patch 3/3 addresses the reader as a new maintainer, yet goes
on to set expectations also for contributors, not just the maintainer.

I do think the documentation for contributors and maintainers/committers
should be kept separate. Most contributors will never care about the
documentation for the latter. We have Documentation/process for
contributors, and I think the audience of Documentation/maintainer
should be strictly maintainers.

In summary, I do think we need all of the documentation you propose, and
I appreciate you taking this on, but I think this should be split by
audience.

BR,
Jani.
