I am not arguing about hotplug fixes in general. I was arguing that this
particular one is a theoretical one and hotplug locking is quite subtle.
E.g. 381eab4a6ee mm/memory_hotplug: fix online/offline_pages called w.o. mem_hotplug_lock
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20181114070909.GB2653@MiWiFi-R3L-srv
So in general unless the issue is really triggered easily I am rather
conservative.

Because the semantic of the OOM event is quite tricky itself. We have
discussed this patch and concluded that the updated one is more
sensible. But it is not yet clear whether this is actually what other
users expect as well. That to me does sound quite risky for a stable
kernel.

which means that AUTOSEL just goes to /dev/null...

If Andrew is happy to get AUTOSEL patches then I will not object of
course but let's not merge these patches without and expclicit OK.
