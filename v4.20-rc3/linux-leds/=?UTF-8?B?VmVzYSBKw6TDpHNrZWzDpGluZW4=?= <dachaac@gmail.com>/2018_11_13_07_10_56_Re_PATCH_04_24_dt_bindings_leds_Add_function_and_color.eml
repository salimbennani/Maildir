What I tried to describe above was that these could also work with HSV 
model also with larger brigtness values too.

Let's say we do following sequence to change from off state to user 
configured intensity value:

# Turn off leds
echo 0 > brightness

# Select requested color
echo "orange" > color

# Use configured LED intensity from user configuration
echo 84 > brightness

Driver would now use rgb value <249 197 9> and brightness <84> to 
calculate (with HSV solution) real PWM values for the led component 
colors. With led controller this is probably easier to get linear 
feedback but for generic PWM controller you may want to utilize PWM 
curve feature like defined for backlight driver.

When thinking this I instantly see my self with thinking PS4's 
sliding/pulsing color animation for orange/blue/white. And controlling 
this animation steps manually from user space probably is not the best 
idea so like with blinking you would need more accurately timed action 
within kernel I suppose (or hardware with the support).

With that idea forward:

# Turning animation sequencer off causes instant changes for values
echo "off" > animation-sequencer

# User 1 second for animation (no effect yet as sequencer is off)
echo 1000 > animation-time-ms (or so)

# Turn off leds (instance change)
echo 0 > brightness

# Select requested color (instant change)
echo "orange" > color

# Change to linear animation sequencer
echo "linear" > animation-sequencer

# Now everything from this point is subject to animation sequencer
# Sequencer remember active state and next state (as seen in sysfs)

# Use configured LED intensity from user configuration (no effect yet)
echo 84 > brightness

# Trigger transition sequence
echo load > animation-sequencer

# This would cause 1 second animation from black to orange with user 
intensivity of 84

# Wait for transition to complete and some extra
sleep 4

# Change color to blue with animation
echo "blue" > color
echo load > animation-sequencer

# This would cause driver to change from orange to blue in current 
intensivity level during 1 second period

# -- end --

Now that went a bit ahead of time but I believe it demonstrates the 
potential for this approach with combined with HSL functionality for future.

I believe that brightness and color should be separate topics.

We have in our devices option in user interface to configure intesivity 
for backlight and in one device also intensivity for status led (this is 
the only PWM led we have :)). (I believe this might be currently 
implemented without actual led driver and directly use PWM interface)

Even in when reduced intensivity we want the color to be set to 
specified value even thou it would not be as bright as full intensivity 
would be.

What do you think?

Thanks,
